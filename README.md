What is Zenario?
-------------------

Zenario is a web-based **content management system** (CMS). It can be used for simple
sites, with many "wysiwyg" features for making regular web pages, news items, blogs and
so on.

It has powerful features for running **extranet** sites, such as customer portals,
and online databases (e.g. of products, documents or vidoes). 

It also has **multilingual** features built in from the core, so that a site can easily
be set up to deliver content in in multiple languages.
