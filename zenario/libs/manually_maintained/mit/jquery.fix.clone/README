This repo contains jquery.fix.clone.js, which if included will fix a couple of
related bugs in jQuery's clone() method.

Originally there were two projects, jquery.fix.textarea-clone and
jquery.fix.select-clone. Those projects still exist, but only so that anyone
using them doesn't end up with broken code. This project is for all clone()-
related bugs going forwards.

Usage is the same as before:

<script src='.../jquery.fix.clone.js'></script>
<!-- At this point your .clone() method will work -->

And MIT license as usual.
