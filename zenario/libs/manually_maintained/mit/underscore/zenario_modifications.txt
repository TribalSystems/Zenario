Added a hack to the template function to make twig-style syntax possible.
(Without this hack, the escape/interpolate patterns ended up matching each other,
causing bugs if both were used on the same line.)

	Replaced
      if (escape) {
	
	With
      var isEscape;
      if (settings.twigStyleSyntax
       && interpolate
       && (isEscape = interpolate.match(/(.*)\|e(|scape)$\s*/))) {
      	escape = isEscape[1];
      	interpolate = false;
      }
      
      if (escape) {


Added a modification such that if you attempt to escape a function,
the function is called and its results are escaped
  Replaced
    return function(string) {

  With
    return function(string) {
      
      if (typeof string == 'function') {
      	string = string();
      }
