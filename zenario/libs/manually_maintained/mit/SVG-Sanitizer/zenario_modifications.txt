Usually we use these "zenario_modifications.txt" files to list small changes we've made.
But in this case, we've pretty much had to rewrite the entire module!

Fixed several PHP errors in the code.
Rewrote the sanitize() function to fix an infinite loop when scanning attributes.
Added a wrapper for the xmlDoc->save() method.
