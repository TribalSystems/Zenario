publish.php

This example will publish a message to a topic.

The results shown above corresponds to publisher's two actions:
```console
$ php publish.php
$ php publish.php
```

When run as a web request you it is ok to just `$mqtt->connect()`, `$mqtt->publish()` and `$mqtt->close()`.
If it is being run as long-running command line script you should run `$mqtt->proc()` regularly in order maintain the connection with the broker.
