# Responsive Cropper Jquery Plugin

Responsive Cropper is a JQuery plugin that lets you select an area from an image and prepare crop information to send it to the server.

You don't need to trigger any event to update crop area when image is resized: this plugin is full responsive.
Crop area uses percentages to guarantee full responsiveness, while crop data is stored separately in absolute values.

You can access to crop data easily throw methods, but also plugin makes things easy for you: inputs are are generated and filled with crop information to send to the server.

Last, you can activate a preview or, even, get a base64 image encoded. All that on the client side.

## Usage

$('#image-4').rcrop({
    minSize : [160,90],
    preserveAspectRatio : true,
    grid : true,
