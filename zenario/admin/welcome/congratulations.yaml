                            <h1>Congratulations</h1>
                            <p>You have installed Zenario!</p>
                            <p>
                                An email has been sent to the email address you entered during the installation,
                                confirming your administrator username and how to log in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have not received this then please check your &quot;spam&quot; folder in
                                case the email has been mis-filed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you still cannot see the email then you - or your server administrator - should
                                check that the PHP Mail Extension is installed, enabled, and correctly configured
                                on your server.
                            </p>
                            <p>
