                            <h1>You have successully installed Zenario</h1>
                            <p>We've sent you an email with your admin login details.</p>
                            <p><em>Make sure you received the email!</em></p>
                            <p>It's important you can receive email from this site, so make sure you received it without it going into spam.</p>
                            <p>If the email didn't arrive, it's possible your server has a problem sending email. Ask your server administrator to ensure the &quot;PHP Mail Extension&quot; is installed, enabled, and correctly configured. If that fails, Zenario can be configured to send email through an SMTP gateway.</p>
                            <p>Configure email in <a href="organizer.php#zenario__administration/panels/site_settings//email" target="_blank">Organizer</a>.</p>
