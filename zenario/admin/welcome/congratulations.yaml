                            <h1>You have successully installed Zenario</h1>
                            <p>An email has been sent to the email address you entered during the installation, confirming your administrator username and how to log in.</p>
                            <h2>Make sure you received the email!</h2>
                            <p>Zenario needs to send emails to you from time to time, so it's important you can receive email from this site.</p>
                            <p>If you have not received this then check your spam folder in case it's been mis-filed.</p>
                            <p>If the email didn't arrive, it's possible your server cannot send email. That could be a problem. Ask your server administrator to ensure the &quot;PHP Mail Extension&quot; is installed, enabled, and correctly configured. If that fails, Zenario can be configured to send email through an SMTP gateway.</p>
                            <p>Configure email in <a href="organizer.php#zenario__administration/panels/site_settings//email" target="_blank">Organizer, Configuration->Site settings->Email</a>.</p>
                            <h2>How to access your site</h2>
                            <p>To access your new site:</p>
                            <p class="align_center"><a class="link_like_button" href="[[site_url]]">Click here</a></p>
                            <p>Your site's URL will be: <a class="link_color" href="[[site_url]]">[[site_url]]</a></p>&nbsp;
