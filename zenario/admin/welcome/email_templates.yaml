            Dear [[NAME]],
            
            The server at [[URL]][[SUBDIRECTORY]] requires additional authentication from you. This may be because you're using a new computer or browser, you've cleared your cookies, your IP address has changed, or because the [[2FA_TIMEOUT]]-day timeout for the security cookie has been reached.
            
            To confirm your login, please click the following button:
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><a style="background: #015ca1; color: white; text-decoration: none; padding: 20px 40px; font-size: 16px;" href="[[URL]][[SUBDIRECTORY]]admin.php?verification_code=[[CODE]]">AUTHENTICATE</a></p>
            
            If the above link doesn't work, copy the following code (all UPPER CASE letters) and paste it into your browser:
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>[[CODE]]</strong></p>
            
            This request was made from IP address [[IP]].
            
            If this was not you, then your website's security may have been compromised and you should immediately change your password.
