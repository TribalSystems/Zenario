            <h1>Administrator account created</h1>
            Dear&nbsp;[[first_name]] [[last_name]],
            
            An administator account has been created for you in the site at [[cms_url]].
            Your administrator username is <strong>[[username]]</strong>.
            
            What to do now:
            1) Follow this link to create a password:
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><a style="background: #015ca1; color: white; text-decoration: none; padding: 20px 40px; font-size: 16px;" href="[[new_admin_cms_url]]">CREATE A PASSWORD</a></p>
            
            2) Login and start administering your site!
            
            Remember that you can always log in with administrator access by putting "/admin" after your site's domain name. Also please note that this is an Administrator login, not an Extranet User login (if the site has a password-protected area for visitors).
