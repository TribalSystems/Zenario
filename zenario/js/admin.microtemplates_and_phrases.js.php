		<p>Depending on how Organizer is currently being accessed by the Admin, it can operate in a different "mode". Organizer has six different modes, and each mode has a lowercase codename.</p>
		<p>You can check the current mode using the <code>$</code><code>mode</code> parameter of your <code>fillStorekeeper()</code> and <code>lineStorekeeper()</code> methods, or the <code>[[ORGANIZER_MODE]]</code> constant:</p>
		<p><strong>full</strong></p>
		<p>This is the "normal" mode of operation; Organizer has been opened in its own browser window and is running full screen.</p>
		<p><strong>select</strong></p>
		<p>This is when the Admin is selecting something from Organizer; Organizer is inside an iframe which is covering the majority of the screen.</p>
		<p>The left-hand navigation is hidden, and navigation may be restricted to a certain area or panel. Depending on the Panel there may be some degree of control to edit or create items.</p>
		<p><strong>quick</strong></p>
		<p>This is when the Admin is editing something on a page using Organizer; Organizer is inside an iframe which is covering the bottom half of the screen, leaving what they are working on still visible at the top.</p>
		<p>The left-hand navigation is hidden, and navigation may be restricted to a certain area or panel. However there is full control to edit or create items.</p>

	'debugHelpTagPath' => <<<_help
		<p>The tag path to a panel is the direct path in the data to the panel - i.e. from the top of the <code>.yaml</code> file to the <code>panel:</code> definition.</p>
		<p>When you create a <code>link</code> to a panel, you will need to specify its tag path.</p>
		<p>When the CMS calls one of your module's methods (e.g. <code>fillOrganizerPanel()</code>) it will specify the tag path of the panel that is being accessed.</p>
_help
	,
	'debugHelpNavigationPath' => <<<_help
		<p>If an administrator clicks a link that uses a refiner, then their current location can no longer be specified using a direct tag path. Instead, a more complicated type of link called a navigation path will appear in the URL bar.</p>
		<p>Navigation paths also work by listing the path taken, however the navigation path will go from the top of the <code>.yaml</code> file to the link that was clicked on.</p>
		<p>If the link was inside an <code>item_button</code> or an <code>inline_button</code>, and an item on the panel was selected, the id of the item will be included in the navigation path.</p>
		<p>As the administrator goes through multiple refiners, the tag path between each link and the id of each item will be added to the navigation path in turn.</p>
_help
	,
	'debugHelpRefiner' => <<<_help
		<p>Refiners modify a panel and change which items that are displayed.</p>
		<p>For example, if you view the "All content items" panel, by default it will show you every content item that isn't trashed.
			However if you to go "Content by language" and click on a language, you will only see content items that are in that language.</p>
		<p>In order to create a working refiner you will need to write some code in SQL and/or PHP.
			You can access your refiners using <code>request('refiner__my_refiner_name')</code> in PHP, and <code>[[REFINER__MY_REFINER_NAME]]</code> in SQL.</p>
