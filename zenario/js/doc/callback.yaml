    Zenario's callback library. An instance of this is commonly returned by any function that deals with AJAX requests.
funs:
    after:
        summary: |
            Adds a function to be called when the callback is complete.
        desc: |
            <p>
                Your function will be called with the result of the callback as its argument
                (or the results of the callbacks as its arguments, if you have chained multiple callbacks together).
            </p>
        returns: |
            Returns the callback object again, so you can use this for method chaining.
    done:
        summary: |
            Mark the callback as completed, and return a result.
        desc: |
            <p>
                The result you give will be added as an argument to the callback function.
            </p><p>
                Note that <code>call()</code> is a deprecated alias for <code>done()</code>.
            </p>
        returns: |
            Returns the callback object again, so you can use this for method chaining.
    add:
        summary: |
            Turn this callback into a wrapper for other callbacks.
        desc: |
            <p>
                Your callback function will be called after all of the callback functions you've added are called,
                and you'll get multiple arguments passed to your callback function (one per callback).
            </p>
        returns: |
            As a shortcut, if you don't specify a callback, this will create one for you and then return it. Otherwise it will return the callback object again, so you can use this for method chaining.
    poke:
        summary: |
            Force a callback to run its functions even if nothing has been registered yet.
        desc: |
            <p>
                If no "after" functions have been registered, this will do nothing.
            </p>
