funs:
    canDoHTML5Upload:
        summary: |
            Checks if the browser supports doing a HTML 5 upload.
    checkFunctionExists:
        summary: |
            This checks whether a named function exists.
        desc: |
            <p>
                If you specify the name of a library, this will check the library for the function,
                otherwise it will check for a global function.
            </p>
    eval:
        summary: |
            Given a snippet of JavaScript code, this does an eval() and returns the results.
        desc: |
            <p>
                Alternately, you can pass an object of functions (as keys) and parameters (as values).
                This is more efficient.
            </p>
        returns: |
            This returns true or false.
    hidden:
        summary: |
            Checks whether a TUIX object should be hidden.
        desc: |
            <p>
                This checks the hidden and visible_if properties as they are generic to all TUIX apps.
                Any properties that are specific to one app are not checked, and need to be checked in the source code for that app.
            </p>
        returns: |
            Returns true or false.
    setHTML5UploadFromDragDrop:
        summary: |
            This function sets an HTML 5 upload on an element.
        desc: |
            <p>
                If you don't specify an element, the upload area is set on the entire page.
            </p>
    showDevTools:
        summary: |
            This checks whether the current admin has permissions to see the dev tools.
        returns: |
            Returns true or false.
    stopDefault:
        summary: |
            A shortcut function to calling the stopPropagation() and preventDefault() methods on an event.
    stopFileDragDrop:
        summary: |
            Disables the ability to navigate away from the current page by dragging a file or an image into the browser from the filesystem.
        desc: |
            <p>
                By default, if a user drags a file from their filesystem onto the browser, the browser
                will navigate away from the current page and try to show the file.
            </p><p>
                Calling this function disables this, and just makes it so that nothing happens.
            </p><p>
                This can be useful, e.g. if a user tries to do a drag-and-drop upload but misses with their
                drag and drop, it stops them losing the page that they were on.
            </p>
