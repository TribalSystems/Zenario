The _cloneObject() function has an infinite recursion bug. We've replaced:

          temp[key] = _cloneObject(object[key]);

...with:

          if (object[key] instanceof jQuery) {
	          temp[key] = object[key];
          } else {
	          temp[key] = _cloneObject(object[key]);
          }

as a workaround to fix the problem in the case it was occurring for us.
