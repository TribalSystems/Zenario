    <p>This Module enables you to display the profile of a given User to visitors.</p>
    <p>The User whose profile you wish to display can be chosen in three ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can choose a specific User by using a Plugin setting</li>
        <li>You can choose the logged in User</li>
        <li>The User can be looked up by seeing if the page on which the Plugin is placed is associated with a User. This enables you to place the Plugin in the Layout Layer for a more maintainable solution.</li>
    </ul>
