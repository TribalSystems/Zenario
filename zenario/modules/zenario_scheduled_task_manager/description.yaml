            <p>
                The Scheduled Task Manager provides support for other Modules to run scheduled tasks at a predefined time.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Module requires a Unix-based server with support for crontabs and PHP from the command line.
                To install it, a sysadmin must add a line of code to the server's crontab (this is generated for you).
                Once this has been done, the Scheduled Task Manager will periodically call all Modules that have a Scheduled Task registered. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You can determine the times and days when a Scheduled Task runs. You can determine the level of logging, and require this Module to report its activity by email. 
                (For example, you might want an email sent every 
                time a Task is run, an email sent only if the Task is run and performs an action, or 
                only if the Task encounters an error.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The Scheduled Backups Module is an example of a Module that uses Scheduled Tasks. It allows periodic backups to be taken automatically.
