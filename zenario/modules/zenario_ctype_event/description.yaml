    <p>
        This is the base Module for Event Content Items in Zenario.
    </p>
    <p>
        Events are version-controlled Content Items (like HTML Pages and other Content Items), and
        when this Module is installed it creates a management panel for Events in the Content
        area of the Admin Back-end. You can then create, edit and publish Events, similar to any other
        Content Item.
    </p>
    <p>
        Events can have start and end dates and times, an external informational URL, and other information.
        You can associate a Location (defined within the Location Manager) with an Event,
        thereby allowing the Event to have an address and Google map for its venue.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Module is pluggable. When you create a Plugin and place it in a Slot on an Event Content Item
        the default behaviour is for its Plugin to display the details of that Event. 
        Alternatively, if you have placed the Plugin on an HTML Page (or any other type of Content Item),
        you can set the Plugin to show details of a different Event (for example, you may wish to
        highlight several Events on a home page).
