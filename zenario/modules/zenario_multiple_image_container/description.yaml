description: |
    <p>The Multiple Image Container (MIC) module allows you to display multiple images on a page in the form of a gallery. Create a plugin from the MIC module for each gallery page.</p>
    
    <p>Images can be uploaded in JPG, PNG format (best quality), or GIF (lesser quality but may be animated). When the module is running, there will be an MIC Images panel in Organizer, underneath the Content Items area, in which administrators can manage all such images in one place.</p>
   
    <p>When uploading images, you may upload as large a version as you like (which means you can decide on the final output size later), and Zenario automatically resizes and caches images at whatever size is set in the plugin settings.</p>
    
    <p>Various gallery styles are possible, and these are determined in CSS. When visitors view the gallery, the usual behaviour is that they see thumbnails initially, and can click on a thumbnail to see it at a larger size.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
