    <p>This Module allows Anonymous visitors to write comments on Content Items, thereby adding a useful
                feedback feature to your web pages.</p>
            <p>The comments editor is equipped with a rich text editor, the features of which can be enabled
                or disabled in this Module's settings.</p>
            <p>This Module allows you to optionally display a name and email, which the visitor is asked for when leaving a message.</p>
            <p>Every time a new comment is created or an existing comment is edited, an email notification can be set to a specified
                email address (typically the Website administrator). You can create and select your own Email
                Template and this will be used to send the report. The selected Email Template can contain various
                Merge Fields that will be replaced by real values when the email is sent. You can use the following
                fields in the Emails sent by the Comments Module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - The URL to the website.</li>
                <li>[[link]] - A link to the page.</li>
                <li>[[message]] - The message that was just created or edited.</li>
                <li>[[page_title]] - The title of the page.</li>
                <li>[[poster_screen_name]] or [[poster_username]] - The Name and/or Email
                    (If the option to display either the name and/or the Email was enabled in the Plugin Settings.)</li>
            </ul>
