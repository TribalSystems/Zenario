    <p>This module allows registered extranet users upload and change their display picture.</p>
            <p>You can set the minimum dimensions of the uploaded image. Any attempt by a user to upload a smaller image will result in an error message.</p>
            <p>You can specify the maximum width and height of the displayed image. The CMS will proportionally reduce the size of larger images so that their dimensions are within the constraints.</p>
