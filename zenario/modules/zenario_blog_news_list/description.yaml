    <p>This module makes a front-end plugin in which visitors can read both Blog and News articles.</p>

    <p>One or both of these "ctype" (Content Type) modules will need to be running. This is intended for sites which display news and blog articles in a list, organised by category rather by the internal content type.</p>
    <p>This module creates a plugin which you should place on a page, and in its settings the administrator can choose which content types are shown. You should enable the use of categories for both content types, for best effect.</p>

    <p>Categories are supported, and you can show a list of categories in a list on one side, beside each article. A user can conveniently click to switch between categories.</p>

    <p>By default the page loads up with no category filtering, but if you link to it with ?category=[category-name] at the end of the URL, you can view just posts from that category.</p>

    <p>In the main column, the most recent articles are shown (typically by release date of the News/Blog item, but you can adjust this in the plugin settings), and the title, featured image and summary are shown (again you can adjust this). A user can click a link to the listed content item and view it in full.</p>

    <p>Supports pinned content items so as to give them priority over other items.</p>
