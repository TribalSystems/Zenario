                <p>An Image Container allows you to display an image on a page in a content-managed way.</p>
                
                <p>The image size can be controlled, and it can be given an link destination plus additional text.</p>
                
                <p>There is support for reponsive websites, in that you can specify an alternate image to be displed when viewed on a mobile device.</p>
                
                <p>Images can be in JPG, PNG and GIF formats. The CMS automatically resizes large images down in size.</p>
                
                <p>If the link from an Image Container is to a content item on this site, the link will be deleted
                automatically if that content item is ever trashed.</p>
                
                <p>If you link to a document on your site, you have the option of linking to its download page, or linking directly to the file download.</p>
                
                <p>Image Containers are nestable; you can insert several of them into a Slideshow plugin to create animated effects.</p>
