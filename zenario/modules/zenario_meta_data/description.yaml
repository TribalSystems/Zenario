            <p>
                Displays the CMS Meta Data of the current Content Item to a visitor.
            </p>
            <p>You can use this Module to display any or all of the following fields on a page:
                <ul>
                    <li>Title</li>
                    <li>Release Date</li>
                    <li>Categories</li>
                    <li>Description</li>
                    <li>Summary</li>
                    <li>Keywords</li>
                    <li>Language</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <p>
                You can use the Settings for this Module to turn each of these on or off, and the 
                Framework to fine-tune the output as seen by visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, you may want to show the Release Date on all of your News Items. To do 
                this, place an Instance of this Module on a News Item, and configure the Settings to 
                show Date. You can choose the date format. To make this display consistently on all News
                Items, you should apply this at a Layout Layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you select Categories in the Module's settings, this Module will display a list of 
                the Public Categories of the Content Item in alphabetical order. (Categories not marked 
                as Public are treated as internal categories only and will not be shown to visitors.)
            </p>
            <p>
                The Public name of the Category - that is, the name seen by visitors - can be stored in 
                all enabled languages, such that visitors see appropriate names for the Category, even 
                though it only has one internal name for administration purposes. You can edit the 
                Public names via the Languages' core phrases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where a Category has a Category Landing Page defined, the name of the Category will 
                also be a hyperlink to that Landing Page.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a helpful feature if you have a large volume of content, such as lists of 
                Documents, or an online store. It would be typical to put a Content Summary List on the
                Landing Page of the Category to list the Category's contents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that Title, Description, Keywords and Language are added to the source 
                &#60;head&#62; area of your pages by default, so there is no need to use this 
                Module for that purpose. This Module is intended only to display the information in the
                viewable &#60;body&#62; areas of the page.
