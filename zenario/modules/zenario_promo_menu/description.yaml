display_name: 'Menu with Promo Images'
description: |
    <p>
        Displays a horizontal menu bar, with multi-column dropdown, so that when a visitor hovers over a level 1 menu node, it shows a large dropdown panel with level 2 and level 3 items.
    </p><p>
        It is designed to show its content across numerous columns, starting from the left, filling down each column to n menu nodes (irrespective of menu level) before filling the next column. n is defined in the plugin settings.
    </p><p>
        In the dropdown there can also be a promotional image and text, with this linking to any destination. There is also a small gallery of images (showing all menu nodes under the current level 1 node that have images).
