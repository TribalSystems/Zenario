        Displays a horizontal menu bar, with multi-column dropdown, so that when a visitor hovers over a level 1 menu node, it shows a large dropdown panel with level 2 and level 3 items.
    </p><p>
        It is designed to show its content across numerous columns, starting from the left, filling down each column to n menu nodes (irrespective of menu level) before filling the next column. n is defined in the plugin settings.
    </p><p>
        In the dropdown there can also be a promotional image and text, with this linking to any destination. There is also a small gallery of images (showing all menu nodes under the current level 1 node that have images).

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
