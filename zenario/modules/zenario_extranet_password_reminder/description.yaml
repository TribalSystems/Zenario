description: |
    <p>This Module allows registered Extranet Users who have forgotten their Password and/or Screen Name to retrieve their details by entering their email address.</p>
            <p>When you install this Module it will automatically create a Password Reminder page on your site. The Module inserts a plugin of this Module on that page.</p>
        <p>Registered Extranet Users will then be able to enter the email address with which they have registered, and the Module will send an email containing their details.</p>
            <p>The default behaviour is to have just one Password Reminder page, however on a multilingual site you may create a Password Reminder page for each Language by creating translations of the original Password Reminder page in each Language.</p>
        <p>This Module installs a password reminder Email Template, which can be edited. The selected Email Template can contain merge fields which will be replaced by real values when the email is sent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>[[first_name]] - User's first name.</li>
            <li>[[last_name]] - User's last name.</li>
            <li>[[screen_name]] - User's screen name.</li>
            <li>[[password]] - User's password.</li>
            <li>[[email]] - User's email address.</li>
            <li>[[hash]] - A hash code required to activate the email address.</li>
            <li>[[ip_address]] - The IP address of the computer from which email address change was requested.</li>
            <li>[[cms_url]] - A Website URL.</li>
        </ul>
