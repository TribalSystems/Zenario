    <p>This module allows extranet users to change their email address.</p>
            <p>A user must be logged in to use this plugin, and must enter their current password and their new email address.</p>
            <p>When the user has entered their password correctly, Zenario sends a a verification email to the existing email address, containing a verification link. When clicked successfully, Zenario sends an email to both the old and the new email address to notify that the change has been made.</p>
            <p>You can create and select your own email template which will be used to send the messages. It can contain various merge fields which will be replaced by real values when the email is sent. You can use the following fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[new_email]] - the new email address</li>
                <li>[[hash]] - a hash code required to activate new email address</li>
                <li>[[ip_address]] - the IP address of the computer from which email address change was requested</li>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - the Website URL</li>
                <li>[[email_confirmation_link]] - the confirmation link to activate email address change.</li>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
