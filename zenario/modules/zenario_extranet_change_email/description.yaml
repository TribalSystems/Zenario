    <p>This Module allows Extranet Users to change their email address.</p>
            <p>As a safety check, before Extranet Users can change their email address, they must enter their current password and their desired new email address.</p>
            <p>When the User requesting the email address change is successfully authenticated, an email message containing a confirmation link is sent to the new email address.</p>
            <p>The email address is changed on clicking the confirmation link in the email message. Before that, no updates to the User account are performed.</p>
            <p>You can create and select your own Email Template which will be used to send the Email Change confirmation message. The selected Email Template can contain various Merge Fields which will be replaced by real values when the email is sent. You can use the following fields in the Emails sent by the Extranet Change Email Module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[new_email]] - New email address.</li>
                <li>[[hash]] - A hash code required to activate new email address.</li>
                <li>[[ip_address]] - The IP address of the computer from which email address change was requested.</li>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - A Website URL.</li>
                <li>[[email_confirmation_link]] - The confirmation link to activate email address change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally the following User data fields can be used: [[screen_name]], [[password]], [[status]], [[last_login]], [[title]], [[first_name]], [[middle_name]], [[maiden_name]], [[last_name]], [[birth_date]], [[email]], [[email_verified]], [[alt_email]], [[website]], [[job_title]], [[company_name]], [[bus_address1]], [[bus_address2]], [[bus_address3]], [[bus_town]], [[bus_state]], [[bus_postcode]], [[bus_country_id]], [[res_address1]], [[res_address2]], [[res_address3]], [[res_town]], [[res_state]], [[res_postcode]], [[res_country_id]], [[address_pref]], [[mobile]], [[bus_phone]], [[res_phone]], [[fax]], [[created_date]].</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
