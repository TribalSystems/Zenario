description: |
    <p>This Module generates a horizontal &quot;top menu&quot; that appears at the top of a webpage when
        viewed on a desktop computer. When viewed on a mobile device, the menu changes to a
        vertical &quot;hamburger&quot; menu.</p>
    
    <p>If you use Grid Maker to make your layouts, this plugin will use the break-point width that you set
        when creating your layout. If you did not use Grid Maker to make your layout, this plugin will
        instead use the break-point width that you entered under <em>Configuration -&gt; Site
        Settings -&gt; File and Image Handling</em>.</p>
    
    <p>If you just wish to use this menu for mobile devices, then you can put it into a slot, edit your layout
        in grid maker, and then set the &quot;Hide on small screens&quot; option for that slot in grid maker.
        Likewise, you can set the &quot;Only show on small screens&quot; to only show it on a desktop computer.</p>
    
    <p>It supports multiple menu sections, providing support for different menu trees.</p>
    
    <p>It is powered by the
        <a href="http://adnantopal.github.io/slimmenu/" target="_blank">
            <em>slimMenu</em></a>
        jQuery plugin, which is licensed under the MIT License.</p>
