    <p>
        This module builds on the User Forms module by allowing form data to be sent on to a CRM (customer relationship management) system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the module is started, you will need to go to Site Settings->Forms and CRM integration and enter your connection details for the CRM. Currently, Salesforce, Mailchimp and 360 Lifecyle are supported. You will need the API key and other details from your CRM.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will need to edit each form's settings to enable that form for CRM integration. And then you will need to edit the form itself to identify the fields that should be sent to the CRM. When selecting a field in the form editor, a "CRM" tab will appear, and you will need to check "Send to CRM" in order to enable the sending of data for that field.

# Reminder: you need to increment the LATEST_REVISION_NO in this module's

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
