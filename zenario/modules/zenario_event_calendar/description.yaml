description: |
    <p>When a Plugin from this Module is inserted into a Slot on a visitor-facing page, it displays a calendar in either month-view or year-view format, highlighting any days/months that contain Events. </p>
            <p>When a visitor clicks on a populated day or month, it displays a popup panel that floats above the web page, inside which are displayed summary details of the relevant event(s). The summaries can contain a hyperlink to the full web page for the event (the Event Content Item).</p>
            <p>You can set the Filter to display all Events, or limit the calendar to display just Events in a given Category.</p>
            <p>You can also use the Filter to show just Events in the current visitor web page language, or to show Events described irrespective of Language.</p>
            <p>Dates and times can be formatted in various ways to support translation into multiple languages (the names of months and days, and the format of dates and times).</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
