description: |
    <p>This module allows the display of a calendar of events.</p>
    <p>When started, the module will allow a plugin to be created, and you should place this in a slot on the content item (e.g. the HTML home page) where you would like the calendar to be shown.</p>
    <p>The calendar can be either in month-view or year-view format, and any days/months that contain events (Event content items) will be highlighted.</p>
    <p>When a visitor clicks on a day or month, it displays a popup panel, inside which are summary details of the relevant events. There can be a link to the Event content item for the event.</p>
    <p>You can set the filter to display all Event content items, or limit the calendar to display just Events in a given category.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
