        This Module allows you to set up and manage a collection of multiple plugins inside the same slot (which is called a nest).
        Any plugin that is marked as &quot;nestable&quot; in its description may placed inside.
    </p><p>
        Plugins in a nest are further sub-divided into different sections called &quot;slides&quot;,
        only one of which may be visible at any one time.
        The links to each slide can be invisible, appear visually as a tab, or in some other visual form,
        depending on the CSS and framework.
    </p><p>
        You can restrict a slide's visibility:
        <ul>
            <li>to logged-in extranet users</li>
            <li>to logged-in extranet users in a given group</li>
            <li>to logged-in extranet users in a given smart group</li>
            <li>by calling a static method from another module, e.g. <code>checkVisitorInCountries()</code> from the <code>zenario_geoip_lookup</code> module</li>
        </ul>
    </p><p>
        There are lots of advanced uses of this plugin. You can:
        <ul>
            <li>
                create multiple slides, with a WYSIWYG Editor or Banner on each slide, to create a tabbed area
            </li>
            <li>
                hide the tab links and use slides with different logic for their visibility
                to create a nest that shows different plugins for different extranet users
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
