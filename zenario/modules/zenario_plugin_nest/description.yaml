    <p>This Module allows you to set up and manage a collection of multiple Plugins inside the same Slot (which is called a Nest).</p>
                
                <p>Nests are managed using the Quick Admin Panel, which allows you to access Admin controls yet still see some of the page you are working on.</p>
                
                <p>To add a Plugin to a Nest you can either copy an existing plugin, or add a new Plugin.</p>
                <p>Once in a Nest, Plugins can be re-ordered, and can be modified in much the same was as any other Plugin in a Slot.</p>
                
                <p>You may quickly create a Banner Plugin inside a Nest by uploading an image from your computer.</p>
                <p>If your browser supports it, you may also create a Banner by dragging and dropping an image into the Quick Admin Panel from your computer.
                    (A broken arrow will appear in the Panel to indicate that this is possible.)</p>
                
                <p>If you are placing Banners in a Nest, there is an option to set a size for every Banner in the Nest, so that you do not have to edit them
                    one-by-one to set their size. If you wish most of the Banners in a Nest to be one size but not all, you may still edit each Banners' Settings
                    individually to create exceptions.</p>
