    <p>This Module lets you export a Content Item a flat file for translation outside of the CMS, either in HTML or XML, then import it after translation.</p>
                <p>All of the version-controlled content on a page - including version-controlled WYSIWYG Editors and Banners - 
                    is included in the export files this Module produces, and will be restored upon importing the file.
                    (Plugins are not exported or restored.)</p>
                <p>The HTML files that it produces are compatible with the
                    <a href="http://translate.google.com/toolkit/" target="_blank">Google Translation Toolkit</a>,
                    allowing you to upload translations and then collaboratively edit or translate them.</p>
                <p>If you have an application key for Google Translate and enter it into the Site Settings,
                    this Module can use Google Translate to automatically translate the text of a Content Item.
                    For example, you could take an English page, duplicate it to create a copy in the French area of your site,
                    then use this Module to translate the English text into French.</p>
