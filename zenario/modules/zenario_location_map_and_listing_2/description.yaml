    <p>
        This module displays a list of locations to visitors,
        and also displays each location on a Google Map.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a tab in the Locations dataset, "Filters", where admins
        can define their filters. There is a list of these filters above the map
        which the visitors can use to display specific types of locations.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The plugin can also be set to filter by dataset field; if this is enabled,
        visitors will only see locations that are in the dataset field,
        and the list of filters will only display the level 2 ones
        within the dataset field set in the plugin settings.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
