            <p>This Module maintains and displays a list of recently viewed Content Items seen by a visitor.</p>
    
            <p>To use, create a plugin and insert it into a Slot on all Content Items that you would like to be recorded as "recently viewed". To apply to the entire site, insert the Module at the Template Family Layer.</p>
    
            <p>Plugins of this Module can be configured in various ways, for example to record only, to display only, or to record and display. Inclusion can be based on Category and/or Content Type, and specific pages can be ignored. "Pots" are used to separate the counts, so a site could for example have a Pot recording viewings of Documents and separately to record viewings of HTML Pages. A Recently Viewed Documents panel could appear on any HTML Page Content Item.</p>
