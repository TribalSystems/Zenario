    <p>This Module displays an email-reply contact form.</p>
            <p>Inserting the Contact Form Module onto a page allows you to provide visitors with the ability to contact you.</p>
            <p>The Module is very easy to set up. Once inserted into a Slot, click the Settings button and enter your email address. You are now ready to receive enquiries from your visitors.</p>
            <p>You can turn on a "captcha" to help prevent spam.</p>
            <p>You can further define which fields a user must complete. There is validation to ensure key fields are entered and that email addresses have a valid format.</p>
            <p>You can create and select your own Email Template which will be used to send an email on Contact Form submission. The Email Template selected can contain various Merge Fields which will be replaced by real values on email sent. You can use the following fields in the Emails sent by the Contact Form Module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[Name_field]] - The name entered on the Form.</li>
