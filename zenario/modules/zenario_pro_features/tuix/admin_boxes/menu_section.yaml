                            A menu section is a major part of the navigation.<br /><br />
                            
                                                        The typical sections of the menu for most sites are: the main menu (usually called Main); and the footer menu (Footer). Sometimes sites have an additional navigation area, such as an area of navigation at the top of every page but away from the main menu; or they may have a menu section that is only used on certain areas of a site, such as in an extranet area or other micro-site.<br /><br />
                                                        You should only make a new menu section if you know what you are doing!
                section_name:
                    label: 'Section name:'
                    type: text
                    maxlength: "20"
                    validation:
                        required: Please enter a name for your new section.
                        screen_name: >
                            The name may contain only alphanumeric characters,
                            underscores and hyphens.
