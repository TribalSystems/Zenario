    <p><b>Menus</b></p>        
        
            <p>
                With the Pro Features Module, you can create new Menu Sections enabling you to improve the
                navigation of your site by providing quicker access to common pages.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The menu system is enhanced so that Menu Nodes can be made Invisible, thereby allowing 
                a Menu Node to exist in the menu hierarchy but without appearing in every 
                visitor-facing menu.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This allows you to display a complete breadcrumb trail to any Content Item, even if 
                that Item is normally reached only via a Content Summary List or a Search.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This feature is essential on sites with thousands of pages, in which menus might otherwise be very long.
            </p>
    
            
            <p>
                Your Menu can be made more attractive through the use of additional functionality made available
                on the Advanced tab. You can specify a CSS class for the Menu Node as well as some descriptive
                text.
            </p>
    
            <p><b>Content</b></p>        
            
            <p>
                You can apply changes to multiple Content Items at once including the Layout, 
                Permissions, and Category assignment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When editing and publishing your Content Items, one archived version will be maintained enabling you
                to rollback to a previous version.
            </p>
    
            <p><b>Languages</b></p>        
    
            <p>
                The Pro Features Module adds a Translations tab to the Admin Toolbar in the front-end. On this tab
                you can manage translations of the Content Item you are currently viewing. This tab will only
                be visible if you have more than one Language enabled.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Country-based Landing Pages</b></p>
            
            <p>The Pro Features Module supports geographical landing pages if you also have the the Geo Landing Pages Module running.</p>
            
            <p>This allows you to define a different landing / home page for your visitors, based on their auto-detected location.</p>
            
            <p><b>Administration</b></p>        
            
            <p>
                With the Pro Features Module running, each of the adminstrator roles contains a set of administrative
                privileges enabling you to precisely define what an adminstrator can or cannot do.
            </p>        
            
            <p>
                Administration of your site can be made more secure by using a site setting to force administrators
                to log in to your site using SSL.
            </p>
