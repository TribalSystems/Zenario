#    You can create new admin permissions by defining new fields in the Permissions
#    admin box.
#    
#    To count as an admin permission:
#        - The fields should be placed under zenario_admin/tabs/permissions/fields
#        - The fields should have the "is_admin_permission" property set to true
#        - The fields should be in the "specific_actions" grouping
#    
#    You may have:
#        - A "type: checkbox" field on its own to act as a single permission.
#        - A "type: checkboxes" field on its own to act as a list of
#          permissions.
#        - A "type:" checkboxes field with the "checking_child_checks_parents"
#          property set to act as a list of permissions with hierarchical dependencies.
#        - A "type: checkbox" field immediately followed by a
#          "type: checkboxes: field to act as a list of permissions that can
#          be quickly turned on or off by the first checkbox. This will also add a
#          toggle button to allow the longer list to be hidden.
#    
#    The CMS will then add the CSS, JavaScript, loading logic and saving logic needed.
