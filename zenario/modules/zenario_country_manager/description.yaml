                This Module is a management tool for countries and regions. The list of countries and/or regions typically
            appears via a Plugin which appears on a visitor-facing page.
            After the Module is installed and set running, its management panel appears beneath International.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each Country has an internal name for admnistration purposes, and a 2-letter ISO code.    
            Countries also have localized names in all of the languages defined for this Module.
            </p>
            <p>
                Double-clicking on a Country in its management panel displays a Regions panel for that
                Country. Using this panel you can define Regions within the Country.
            </p>
            <p>
            Countries have a Status which may be set to Active or Suspended. Only countries marked as Active will
                be displayed to visitors. The Module comes with over 240 countries defined, and countries can be added or deleted
            by an administrator.

                This Module is not slotable, but its features may be used by other Modules. It is designed so that
                another Module can make a static method call from its framework to obtain a list of
                Countries or Regions, for example in a form in which a visitor should select his country and/or region.
