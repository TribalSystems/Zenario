description: |
    <p>This module creates a plugin that displays a sitemap of a Zenario website.</p>
    
    <p>The sitemap will include all content items in the menu hierarchy, and they will be displayed in a structured way.</p>
    
    <p>Content items that are private (i.e. password-protected for extranet users) may or may not appear, depending on the setting of the menu node linking to each content item, thus they can be made to appear only when an extranet user is logged in. The module follows the same rules as for regular menus.</p>
    
    <p>The administrator may choose which menu section to display (default is Main), and how many levels to descend. The usual behaviour is to not show menu nodes marked as "invisible".</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
