display_name: Menu (Responsive Multilevel)
description: |
    <p>Displays a portion of the hierarchical menu of your Zenario website, using a horizontal list. This is designed to be used as a top menu.</p>
    
    <p>This Module can generate different types of menu, including "popout" menus (which appear upon mouseover).</p>

    <p>The navigation bar is horizontally arranged; for a vertical navigation bar, use the Menu (Vertical) Plugin.</p>

    <p>It supports a change of style (e.g. colour) of a Menu Node when a user's mouse is hovering over that Menu Node.
        It also supports the display of an indication of the visitor's current location.</p>

    <p>In Administration Mode the generated menu contains "Add a Menu Node here" icons, which help an Author rapidly expand and develop a web site.</p>

    <p>It supports displaying the menu hierarchy from any of 7 different levels - from Levels 1 to 5, and two levels that are relative to the current Content Item.
        In addition, it is possible to reverse the display order of the menu nodes, i.e. right to left, which is helpful when working with RTL languages,
        and designs which have a float-right style.</p>

    <p>It supports multiple menu sections, providing support for different menu trees.</p>
    
    <p>It is powered by the <a href="http://github.com/codrops/ResponsiveMultiLevelMenu" target="_blank"><em>Responsive Multi-Level Menu</em></a> jQuery plugin,
        which is licensed under the MIT License.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
