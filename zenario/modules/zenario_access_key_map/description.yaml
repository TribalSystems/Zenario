            <p>Using Access Keys a visitor can navigate a site using the keyboard rather than the mouse. This Module generates an Access Key Map of your Zenario website, according to Access Keys set up for each Menu Node.</p>
            <p>The Access Key Map Module will display all Published pages that are in the Menu hierarchy.</p>
            <p>Items which are private (i.e. password-protected for Extranet Users only) may only appear in the Access Key Map when a User is logged in, according to the setting on each Menu Node.</p>
