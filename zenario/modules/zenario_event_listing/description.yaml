    <p>This module allows a Zenario site to display events in a list.
        </p>
    <p>
        It requires the Event content type to be running, as it displays details of those events.
    </p>
    <p>
        After starting the module, create a plugin of this module, and then place this in a slot on the content item (e.g. the HTML home page) where you would like the list of events to be shown.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a visitor clicks on an item in the list, it links to the Event content item for the event.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can set the filter to display all Event content items, or limit the calendar to display just Events in a given category.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
