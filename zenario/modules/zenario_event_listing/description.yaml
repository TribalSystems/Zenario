            <p>
                This Module displays a list of Event content items to a visitor.
            </p>
            </p>
                To display a list of events on a visitor-facing page, insert a plugin of this module into a slot on an HTML content item.
            <p>
            </p>
                The events in the listing can be filtered by events in a given time period relative to the current time.
                They can also be filtered by category of event content item, and by language.
            <p>
            </p>
                The Event Content Type depends on the Location Manager module, so that Event content items can be associated with locations.
                This allows you, optionally, to group events together when they take place at the same location.
                If the Event Listing plugin is placed on a slot on the layout that's used for HTML pages, and those
                HTML pages are identified as the Descriptive Pages of locations, then the Event Listing plugin can be made to
                automatically show the events for the described location.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
