            <p>
                This Module displays a list of Events to a visitor.
            </p>
            </p>
                Inserting an Instance of this Module into a Slot on a visitor-facing page will display a
                list of Events (which may take place on a single or multiple days).
            <p>
            </p>
                The Events in the listing can be filtered by all events in a given time period, events 
                from a certain Category in a given time period or events associated with a Location's 
                HTML page that fall within the time period.
            <p>
            </p>
                When filtering using a time period you can choose between the current day, the current 
                week, the current calendar month, the current year or all time.
            <p>
            </p>
                You can further filter your Event Listing by choosing to display current events, future
                events and/or past events.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
