,,In the Admin Back-end, English is used for all of the interfaces. However if your
,,Module is a slotable Plugin then you will need to provide an output for visitors to
,,the site, and any text should be output in the same language as the Content Item
,,that the Plugin is on.

,,Do enable this, Tribiq CMS uses Phrases. Phrases consist of a Phrase Code (by which
,,they are referenced in your PHP code and your frameworks) and some localized text
,,(which the visitor will see on the screen).

,,While you could force your users to write their own Phrases for your Plugin, we
,,recommend that you ship your Module with at least a set of predefined phrases in
,,English.

,,The 'phrases' directory of your Module should contain CSV files such as this one,
,,containing the Phrases for each language you wish to ship with.
,,The files need to be named after the language codes of the languages they are for,
,,for example 'en.csv' or 'fr.csv'.

,,When your Module is installed, the Phrases from these files will be copied into the
,,visitor phrases core table in the database.

,,Note that if you choose to inherit the Phrases of a different Module, you should not
,,create any phrase files as you are not using your own Phrases.

,,The format of these csv files is identical to the format used in the Export/Import
,,Language Phrases tools in the CMS, except that only Phrases for your Module should
,,appear.
,,These can be created using a spreadsheet program, or if you are careful to manually
,,add all of the escape characters, a text editor.
,,The format is as follows:
