            <p>The Location Viewer displays details of a Location (as managed by the zenario Location Manager in the Admin Back-end).</p>
    
            <p>Details of a Location include its name, website, address, phone and other information. If you have defined a Google Map for this Location, Location Viewer can show a map of the Location. You can define the output format using the Framework HTML for this Module's Plugins.</p>
    
            <p>A Location can have a Content Item associated with it (as defined in the Settings for the Location); you can then use that Content Item to hold a richer HTML description of the location. When a Location Viewer Plugin is then placed in a Slot on such a Content Item, it displays the details of the Location to that that Content Item describes.</p>
    
            <p>This is powerful because on a website showing many Locations you can create a Layout in which Location Viewer is placed in a Slot on the Layout Layer. That way, whenever you create a new Location and its descriptive HTML Page, you only need to select the correct Layout for the page to make it show the correct details.</p>
    
            <p>Alternatively you can define a Plugin that displays the details of a specific Location, and place it on an unrelated HTML Page.</p>
    
            <p>Note that Location Viewer always displays a Location's data, regardless of its Active status.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
