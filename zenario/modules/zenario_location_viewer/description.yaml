            <p>The Location Viewer displays details of a Location (as managed by the Location Manager in Organizer).</p>
    
            <p>Details of a location include its name, website, address, phone and other information. If you have defined a Google Map for this Location, Location Viewer can show a map of the Location. You can define the output format using the Framework HTML for this Module's Plugins.</p>
    
            <p>A location can have a descriptive content item associated with it; you can then use that content item to hold a richer description of the location. When a Location Viewer plugin is placed in a slot on such a content item, it displays the details of the related location automatically.</p>
    
            <p>Alternatively you can define a plugin that displays the details of a specific Location, and place it on any HTML page.</p>
    
            <p>Note that Location Viewer always displays a location's data, regardless of whether the status of the location is active.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
