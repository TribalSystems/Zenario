# You must use a tab-size of 4 spaces to edit this file.

#    This file contains descriptive information about your module.
#    
#    Every module you create must have a YAML file with some basic information about
#    that module in it.
#    
#    Some of this information is descriptive: for example you must give your module a
#    name and a textural description.
#    
#    Some of this information is used to enable certain features: for example there is a
#    tag that you must include before your module can act as a Plugin and can create
#    Instances.
#    
#    Please note that some properties are cached in the database when a module
#    is installed or updated. Any changes you make to them may not appear until you
#    increment your module's revision number.
