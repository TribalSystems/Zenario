    <p>This module allows visitors to the site to register and become extranet users.</p>
    <p>When you install this module it will automatically create a registration page on your site.</p>
    <p>The default behaviour is to have just one registration page, but on a multi-language site you may create one page for each language on your site by creating translations of the original content item in each language.</p>
    <p>To register, people must enter their email address (and choose a screen name, if you have enabled screen names in your site's settings).</p>
    <p>The default setup for this plugin will make it send a verification email to the email address given by a new user, and that the user chooses their own password; but other configurations are possible.</p>
    <p>It is possible for administrators to receive notification of each user who signs up, set this on the plugin's "User activation" tab.</p>
    <p>You can create your own or customize existing email templates. The email template can contain various merge fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[first_name]] - user's first name</li>
                <li>[[last_name]] - user's last name</li>
                <li>[[screen_name]] - user's screen name</li>
                <li>[[password]] - user's password (only available at the time of sign-up)</li>
                <li>[[email]] - user's email address</li>
                <li>[[hash]] - a hash code required to activate the email address (for use in email verification templates only)</li>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - this website's URL
                <li>[[email_confirmation_link]] - a confirmation link to finish registration process (for use in email verification email templates only)</li>
                <li>[[organizer_link]] - a link to the newly created user in Organizer (for use in admin notification templates only).</li>
                <li>[[user_groups]] - comma separated list of groups to which user is signed up (can only be used after user's email address verification).</li>
            </ul>
    <p>The user's status will remain pending until they have confirmed their email address. Once they have done this, they will be made 'active' and will be able to log in to your site.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to avoid users activating themselves, you can choose that an administrator manually activates all new users.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
