    <p>This module reads an RSS or Atom feed from a third-party site, and displays the content on a Zenario site.</p>
    <p>To use it, start the module, make a plugin, specify the source and other settings, and place it in a slot on a content item.</p>
    <p>It supports a caching mechanism, to avoid unnecessary requests to the source website.</p>
    <p>You can specify date and time formatting, what amount of content to display, the target of any links, and how long to cache.</p>
    <p>You can add a text filter to the incoming feed so that only certain items are displayed. Using a regular expression (text filter) applied to the title, description or date of the incoming data, you can specify that only the matching items are displayed.</p>
