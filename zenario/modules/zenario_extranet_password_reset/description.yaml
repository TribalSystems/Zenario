description: |
    <p>This Module allows registered Extranet Users who have forgotten their password to reset by entering their email address.</p>
    <p>When you install this Module it will automatically create a Password Reset page on your site. The Module inserts a plugin of this Module on that page.</p>
    <p>Registered Extranet Users will then be able to enter the email address with which they have registered, and the Module will send an email containing a link to a page where they can enter a new password.</p>
    <p>The default behaviour is to have just one Password Reset page, however on a multilingual site you may create a Password Reset page for each Language by creating translations of the original Password Reset page in each Language.</p>
    <p>This Module installs a password reset Email Template, which can be edited. The selected Email Template can contain merge fields which will be replaced by real values when the email is sent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[[first_name]] - User's first name.</li>
        <li>[[last_name]] - User's last name.</li>
        <li>[[screen_name]] - User's screen name.</li>
        <li>[[email]] - User's email address.</li>
        <li>[[hash]] - A hash code required to activate the email address.</li>
        <li>[[ip_address]] - The IP address of the computer from which email address change was requested.</li>
        <li>[[cms_url]] - A Website URL.</li>
    </ul>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
