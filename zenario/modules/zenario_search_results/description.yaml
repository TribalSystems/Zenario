	<p>
				This Module allows visitors to search your site's content against entered keywords.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you install this Module it will automatically create a Search page on your site.
			</p>
			<p>
				The default behaviour is to have just one Search page,
				however you may create a Search page for each Language on your site
				by creating translations of the original Search page in each Language.
			</p>
			<p>
				Either all or any of the following information sources can be searched: page title, page
				description, defined keywords, alias, and WYSIWYG Editors or HTML Snippets on 
				the page. (Only version controlled content is searched. Plugins are not searched.) Each information source can be given its own search weighting enabling you to
				easily tune your search.
			</p>
			<p>
				Visitors can also filter their search results by Category, if you choose to enable this
				feature and have created some public Categories.
