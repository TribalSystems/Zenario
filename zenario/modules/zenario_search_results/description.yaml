            <p>
                This Module allows visitors to search your site's content against entered keywords.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you install this Module it will automatically create a Search page on your site.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default behaviour is to have just one Search page,
                however you may create a Search page for each Language on your site
                by creating translations of the original Search page in each Language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either all or any of the following information sources can be searched: page title, page
                description, defined keywords, alias, and WYSIWYG Editors or HTML Snippets on 
                the page. (Only version controlled content is searched. Plugins are not searched.) Each information source can be given its own search weighting enabling you to
                easily tune your search.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visitors can also filter their search results by Category, if you choose to enable this
                feature and have created some public Categories.
