description: |
    <p>This module allows extranet users to write comments on content items, thereby adding a useful
                feedback feature to blogs and other web pages.</p>
            <p>It also enables the basic functionality needed to install a forum.</p>
            <p>The comments editor is equipped with a rich text editor, the features of which can be enabled
                or disabled in this plugin's settings.</p>
            <p>You can restrict posting comments and grant moderation privileges to selected groups.
                You can allow users to modify and/or delete their own posts and report an offensive comment.</p>
            <p>This module allows you to optionally display information about the person posting each comment,
                including: name, online status, post count, sign-up date, job title and avatar.</p>
            <p>Every time a new comment is created or an existing comment is edited, an email notification can be set to a specified
                email address (typically a site administrator).
                The email template can contain various
                merge fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - The URL to the website.</li>
                <li>[[link]] - A link to the page.</li>
                <li>[[message]] - The message that was just created or edited.</li>
                <li>[[page_title]] - The title of the page.</li>
                <li>[[poster_screen_name]] - The Screen Name of the extranet user who posted the message.
                    (Note that this will only appear if Screen Names are enabled in Configuration->Site Settings, Users and Contacts interface.)</li>
                <li>[[poster_username]] - The username of the extranet user who posted the message.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the subscription feature is enabled, extranet users can subscribed to a page to receive notifications
                of any comments made there. Each subscriber will be sent an email when a comment is posted on that page.
                These emails also use an Email Template, in which you can use any of the fields above (except for
                [[poster_username]] as Usernames are private), and in addition the following fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[subscriber_email]] - The email of the subscribing user.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_title]] - The title of the subscribing user.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_first_name]] - The first name of the subscribing user.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_middle_name]] - The middle name of the subscribing user.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_last_name]] - The last name of the subscribing user.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_screen_name]] - The Screen Name of the subscribing user.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_username]] - The username of the subscribing user.</li>
            </ul>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
