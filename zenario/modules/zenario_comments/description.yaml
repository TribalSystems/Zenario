    <p>This Module allows Extranet Users to write comments on Content Items, thereby adding a useful
                feedback feature to your web pages.</p>
            <p>It also enables the basic functionality needed to install a Forum.</p>
            <p>The comments editor is equipped with a rich text editor, the features of which can be enabled
                or disabled in this Module's settings.</p>
            <p>You can restrict posting comments and grant moderation privileges to selected Groups.
                You can allow Users to modify and/or delete their own posts and report an offensive comment.</p>
            <p>This Module allows you to optionally display information about the person posting each comment,
                including: name, online status, post count, sign-up date, job title and avatar.</p>
            <p>Every time a new comment is created or an existing comment is edited, an email notification can be set to a specified
                email address (typically the Website administrator). You can create and select your own Email
                Template and this will be used to send the report. The selected Email Template can contain various
                Merge Fields that will be replaced by real values when the email is sent. You can use the following
                fields in the Emails sent by the Comments Module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - The URL to the website.</li>
                <li>[[link]] - A link to the page.</li>
                <li>[[message]] - The message that was just created or edited.</li>
                <li>[[page_title]] - The title of the page.</li>
                <li>[[poster_screen_name]] - The Screen Name of the Extranet User who posted the message.
                    (Note that this will only appear if Screen Names are enabled in the Site Settings.)</li>
                <li>[[poster_username]] - The Username of the Extranet User who posted the message.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the subscription feature is enabled, Extranet Users can subscribed to a page to receive notifications
                of any comments made there. Each subscriber will be sent an email when a comment is posted on that page.
                These emails also use an Email Template, in which you can use any of the fields above (except for
                [[poster_username]] as Usernames are private), and in addition the following fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[subscriber_email]] - The email of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_title]] - The title of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_first_name]] - The first name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_middle_name]] - The middle name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_last_name]] - The last name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_screen_name]] - The Screen Name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_username]] - The Username of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
            </ul>
