    <p>
        This module displays a list of locations to visitors,
        and also displays each location on a Google Map.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is an option to filter by country; if this is enabled
        a country selector will appear on the page, and visitors will only
        see locations that are in the selected country. (Locations that are
        not associated with a country will not appear.)
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also option to filter by up to three custom fields; if this option is
        enabled then the visitor will see up to three different lists. (Locations that are
        in multiple lists will appear multiple times, once on each list.)
    </p>
    <p>
        This module will not work "out of the box". It needs a designer to write
        CSS code before it will display on the screen.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
