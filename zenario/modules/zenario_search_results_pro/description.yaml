                This Module allows visitors to search your site's content against entered keywords.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either all or any of the following information sources can be searched: page title, page
                description, defined keywords, alias, and WYSIWYG Editors or HTML Snippets on 
                the page. (Only version controlled content is searched. Plugins are not searched.) Each information source can be given its own search weighting enabling you to
                easily tune your search.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visitors can also filter their search results by Category, if you choose to enable this
                feature and have created some public Categories.
            </p>
            <p>
                Search results are separated into HTML Pages, News and Documents in a tabbed interface.
            </p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
