description: |
    <p>This is an essential Module which displays a breadcrumb trail to the currently viewed Content Item.</p>
    
    <p>The Menu Node name of your Home page (often the word "Home") is prepended, so that users see a breadcrumb trail of the form:</p>
    
    <pre>Home > Products > Zenario > Pro </pre>
    
    <p>Each part of the breadcrumb trail is a hyperlink to the relevant page. You may customize the character separator (> in the above example) via the Module's settings.</p>
    
    <p>You can use this Module in connection with Invisible Menu Nodes. When a Menu Node is Invisible it will appear in the breadcrumb trail but not in the regular menu navigation.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
