description: |
    <p>This is an essential Module which displays a breadcrumb trail to the currently viewed Content Item.</p>
    
    <p>The Menu Node name of your Home page (often the word "Home") is prepended, so that users see a breadcrumb trail of the form:</p>
    
    <pre>Home > Products > Zenario > Pro </pre>
    
    <p>Each part of the breadcrumb trail is a hyperlink to the relevant page. You may customize the character separator (> in the above example) via the Module's settings.</p>
    
    <p>You can use this Module in connection with Invisible Menu Nodes. When a Menu Node is Invisible it will appear in the breadcrumb trail but not in the regular menu navigation.</p>
