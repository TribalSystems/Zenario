display_name: Menu Breadcrumb Trail
description: |
    <p>This module makes a plugin that displays a menu navigation breadcrumb trail for the currently viewed content item.</p>
    
    <p>The menu node name of your home page ("Home" by default) is displayed at the start of the breadcrumb trail. For example, visitors on some page "Zenario" may see a breadcrumb trail of the form:</p>
    
    <pre>Home > Products > Zenario </pre>
    
    <p>Each word or part of the breadcrumb trail is a hyperlink to the relevant page, which will be a parent of the current page. You may customize the character separator (> in the above example) via the plugin's settings, or using CSS.</p>
    
    <p>If a menu node is flagged as "invisible", it will appear in the breadcrumb trail when a visitor is on the relevant content item, but it will be invisible in other menus.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
