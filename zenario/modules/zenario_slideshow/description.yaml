    <p>
        This module allows you to create an animated slideshow.
    </p><p>
        Each slide will contain one plugin, such as a Banner plugin (which can have an image, text and a hyperlink). But in fact any plugin that is &quot;nestable&quot; may be placed on a slide.
    </p><p>
        You can create dynamic effects for your visitors, controlling all aspects of display and slide transitions.
        The slides can auto-advance after a set delay, or slides can be set to only advance when a visitor clicks Next or Prev.
    </p><p>
        Animation effects are available via the
           <a href="http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/" target="_blank">jQuery Cycle</a> or
           <a href="https://github.com/fredleblanc/roundabout" target="_blank">jQuery Roundabout</a>
          libraries (you can choose which you want in the slideshow's settings).
    </p><p>
        The links to each slide can be invisible, appear visually as a tab, or in some other visual form,
        depending on the CSS and framework.
    </p><p>
        You can set permissions on a slide-by-slide basis, so that only extranet users can see a slide, only users in a given group, only users in a given smart group, or you can create rules (such as by-country control) by calling a static method from another module (e.g. <code>checkVisitorInCountries()</code> from the <code>zenario_geoip_lookup</code> module).

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
