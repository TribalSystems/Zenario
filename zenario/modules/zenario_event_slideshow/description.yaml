    <p>
        This module provides a slideshow plugin that shows future events.
    </p><p>
        The slideshow can be navigated with forward and back buttons to look at events. Only events
        (event content items) that are in the future or today will be shown. 
        The plugin settings provide options to filter events by category, and maximum thumbnail height.
    </p><p>
        If an event has an image marked as "sticky", then that image will be used as a thumbnail. Otherwise the event title will be shown instead. The slide is a hyperlink to the event content item.
