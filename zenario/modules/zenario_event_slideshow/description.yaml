    <p>
        This module provides a slideshow plugin that shows future events.
    </p><p>
        The slideshow can be navigated with forward and back buttons to look at events. Only events
        (event content items) that are in the future or today will be shown. 
        The plugin settings provide options to filter events by category, and maximum thumbnail height.
    </p><p>
        If an event has a featured image, that image will be used as a thumbnail. Otherwise the event title will be shown instead. The slide is a hyperlink to the event content item.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
