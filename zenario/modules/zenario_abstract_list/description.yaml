# You must use a tab-size of 4 spaces to edit this file.

#    This file contains descriptive information about your module.
#    
#    Every module you create must have a YAML file with some basic information about
#    that module in it.
#    
#    Some of this information is descriptive: for example you must give your module a
#    name and a textural description.
#    
#    Some of this information is used to enable certain features: for example there is a
#    tag that you must include before your module can act as a Plugin and can create
#    Instances.
#    
#    Please note that some properties are cached in the database when a module
#    is installed or updated. Any changes you make to them may not appear until you
#    increment your module's revision number.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
