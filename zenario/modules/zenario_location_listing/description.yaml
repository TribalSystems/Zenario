            <p>
                This Module displays a list of the geographical Locations as defined in the Location 
                Manager Module in the Admin Back-end of a site.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Only Locations marked as Active are displayed, others are not shown. When defining a 
                listing, you can specify a filter to display only Locations in a given Business Sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are built-in pagination controls, and control over sort order. You can decide to 
                sort on up to three parameters: Name and Country (which are built in), and on other 
                parameters such as Sector Score if the Location Ratings Module is installed.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
