            <p>
                This Module displays a list of the geographical Locations as defined in the Location 
                Manager Module in the Admin Back-end of a site.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Only Locations marked as Active are displayed, others are not shown. When defining a 
                listing, you can specify a filter to display only Locations in a given Business Sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are built-in pagination controls, and control over sort order. You can decide to 
                sort on up to three parameters: Name and Country (which are built in), and on other 
                parameters such as Sector Score if the Location Ratings Module is installed.
