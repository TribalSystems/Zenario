                            <h2>Skins in Zenario</h2>

                            <p>This panel shows files on the server filesystem, which are CSS and other files.
                                Put together they form a Skin.</p>

                            <p>Whereas a Layout determines the overall layout of web pages, the Layout's Skin determines fonts,
                                colours, graphics and other styling, animations and other behaviours.</p>

                            <h3>Skin description</h3>

                            <p>The description.yaml file holds meta information for a skin, and can contain styles
                                that appear in the Formats box of the WYSIWYG editor.</p>

                            <p>It can only be edited on the file system.</p>

                            <h3>Editable CSS</h3>

                            <p>The editable_css folder contains the principle styling of the site, and if you are
                                designing a site then you should make most of your CSS changes in here.</p>

                            <p>While these files are not editable in Organizer, if you go to the front end of the
                                site and use the Layout mode, you should be able to edit the CSS there using a
                                what-you-see-is-what-you-get type interface.</p>

                            <p>Most files are prefixed with a number, and they are included in numerical order:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>0.reset.css is always included first</li>
                                <li>Other number-prefixed files in are included in numerical then alphabetical order</li>
                                <li>Unnumbered print.css and browser-specific files
                                    (such as browser-specific stylesheets like style_ie.css) are included last.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Colorbox</h3>

                            <p>Zenario includes the jQuery plugin Colorbox which is used by various Zenario plugins
                                (e.g. MIC, Banner, Form Container etc.) where they may display content in a pop-up (modal window).
                                The appearance of the pop-ups are controlled through the CSS file colorbox.css found on this folder.
                                You can edit this file to restyle the pop ups appearance. </p>

                            <p>Only editable on the file system.</p>

                            <h3>Fonts (optional folder)</h3>

                            <p>If you use custom fonts you can upload the web font kit into this folder (a web font kit
                                includes the multiple font file extensions such as .eot, .woff, .woff2, .ttf or .svg).</p>

                            <p>Only editable on the file system.</p>

                            <h3>Images</h3>

                            <p>The images folder contains images that are referred to by the skin's CSS files (most commonly
                                by files in editable_css, but potentially by other CSS).</p>

                            <p>Only editable on the file system.</p>

                            <h3>Installer (optional folder)</h3>

                            <p>This is only relevant for skins pre-packaged with Zenario, and includes things in the install process.</p>

                            <h3>jQuery</h3>

                            <p>Zenario includes the jquery library, so the jquery_ui folder contains CSS and images that jQuery uses.</p>

                            <p>Only editable on the file system.</p>

                            <h3>JavaScript</h3>

                            <p>The js folder includes custom JavaScript that is used on the site.</p>

                            <p>Only editable on the file system.</p>

                            <h3>Combining CSS into a single file</h3>

                            <p>By default, Zenario combines multiple CSS files together into one file to reduce the number of
                                downloads and make your website load faster.</p>
                            
                            <p>Designers may want to turn this off for easier debugging. You can turn access this setting at
