                        Compress web pages, CSS files and JavaScript files to reduce bandwidth and download times;
                        if a visitor's browser supports compression.
                        (Images and animations will always be compressed if compression is possible, even if this setting is switched off.)
                        <br/>
                        If you have the zlib extension installed in php 5.4 or higher, this setting will be ignored and
                        compression will always be done automatically by the server.

                        Reduce the number of downloads by combining multiple CSS files together.
                        This will make your website load faster, but designers may want to turn this off for easier debugging.
                        (Core files for the CMS will always be combined.)

                        Enabling the query cache in MySQL will speed up the CMS when repeated queries are made to the database,
                                                    resulting in faster page-generation times and less load on the server.
                                                    This feature can be enabled by your server administrator.

                        If you have a second domain name pointing to this site, you may use this as a cookie-free domain
                                                    from which to serve images, CSS files and JavaScript files.

                        This must be a domain that points to this site, and to be cookie-free it must not share cookies with this domain.
                                                        For example, if your primary domain was &quot;www.example.com &quot;, you could use  &quot;static.example.com &quot; as a cookie-free domain.
                                                        However if your primary domain was  &quot;example.com &quot;, you couldn't use  &quot;static.example.com &quot; as a cookie-free domain as this
                                                        subdomain would share cookies with  &quot;example.com &quot; - but you could set up a whole new domain (e.g.  &quot;yoursite-images.com &quot;)
                                                        to use as a cookie-free domain.

                    note_below: |
                        If this is enabled, your site will show technical details of error messages to any visitor.
                                                    This can be helpful while your site is under construction, but should usually be left off for security reasons.
                show_notices:

                    type: checkbox
                    read_only: Yes
                    note_below: |
                        If run-time notices are enabled, the CMS and any Modules enabled on your site will show messages whenever they
                                                        encounter anything that may indicate an error. However these messages may also appear in the normal course of running of your site.
                                                        <br/>
                                                        These messages can be useful for websites in development, but should never be enabled for a live site.
                                                        You can change this setting by editing your <code>zenario_siteconfig.php</code> file.
                                                        <br/>
                                                        You must disable the &quot;Compress Web Pages&quot; Site Setting on the &quot;Speed&quot; tab if you use this level of error reporting,
                                                        as some PHP generated notices will cause Content Encoding Errors when GZip compression is enabled.

                    type: checkbox
                    read_only: Yes
                    note_below: |
                        If strict errors are enabled, the CMS and any Modules enabled on your site will show messages whenever they
                                                        encounter any PHP code that is no longer compatible with the latest version of PHP.

                                                        You can change this setting by editing your <code>zenario_siteconfig.php</code> file.

                    note_below: |
                        You should normally leave these messages enabled.
