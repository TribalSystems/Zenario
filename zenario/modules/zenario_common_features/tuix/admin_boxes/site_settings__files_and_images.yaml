                            instead of generating a new one on the fly. This reduces the load on your server and make your
                            web pages load more quickly for visitors.

                            When Zenario resizes a JPEG image to create a thumbnail, the new image is then recompressed.
                            This compresson algorithm can use a quality of between 0 and 100.

                        The lower this number the smaller the filesize of the thumbnail will be, however if you set setting it
                        too low then you may see artifacts on your thumbnails for JPEG images.

                            Zenario makes WebP images from JPG and PNGs that have been uploaded, and saves them in the 'public' cache directory.
                            WebP images are normally smaller in size than the JPG/PNG from which they are made.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            Use the slider to set the quality. 90 is recommended, 100 is better but images that have already been optimised
                            while JPG/PNG may become larger when converted to WebP.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            If changing the setting, this will only have effect on newly created WebP images in the 'public' directory, and will not change existing ones.
