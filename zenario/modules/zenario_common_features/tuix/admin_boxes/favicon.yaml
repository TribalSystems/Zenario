                            You may upload an .ico file to use as a Favicon, and a .gif or a .png to use as a Home Screen Icon for mobile devices.

                    note_below: >
                        You should upload a .ico file for a favicon.
                        (You can also use a .gif or a .png, however these will not display for visitors
                         using Internet Explorer 10 or earlier.)
                        The image should be either 16×16, 32×32, 48×48 or 64×64 pixels in size.

                mobile_icon: 
                    label: "Home screen icon:"
                    upload: 
                        accept: "image/*"
                        extensions: 
                            - .gif
                            - .png
                        drag_and_drop: false
                    note_below: >
                        You should upload a .gif or a .png file for a home-screen icon.
                        We recommend that the image should be 144×144 pixels in size;
                        the image will be auto-downsized.
