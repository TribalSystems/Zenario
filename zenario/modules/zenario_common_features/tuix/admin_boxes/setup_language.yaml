                        The CMS will redirect a visitor to the home page of this language based on the
                        language requested by their browser.

                        When a visitor accesses the site without a specific page set in their URL,
                        they will be directed to the home page of this language if their requested
                        language matches one of the language codes listed here (comparison is case-insensitive).
                        Enter one or more language codes, separate multiple codes with a comma.

                        it will search for a translation in the database.
                        Otherwise it will just use them as-is.
                        
                        If a phrase starts with an underscore it will always be looked up.
