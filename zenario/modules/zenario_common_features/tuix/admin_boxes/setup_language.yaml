                                If the site has more than one enabled language, you may make a translation of each content item into the secondary languages.
                                The content items are related via a "translation chain", as they are likely to contain equivalent content.

                                Zenario can create "phrases" for words or sentences that appear in certain plugins that appear on web pages (such as Banner plugins).
                                It also does this for phrases included in modules' program code.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To create phrases, look for the "Uses phrases" icon on the settings panel of the plugin. The plugin must be on a page for which a non-[[language_english_name]] translation exists.
                                When that content item is viewed, a phrase is created in the database, and can be seen in theÂ phrases panel.
                                You can find all phrases there, and enter translations for them into the site's other languages.

                                To create phrases, edit a plugin on a content item in the default language ([[default_language_english_name]]), and look for the "Uses phrases" icon on the settings panel of the plugin.
                                The plugin must be on a page for which a translation in [[language_english_name]] exists.
                                When the content item on which the plugin is placed is viewed (by an administrator or a visitor) a phrase is created in the phrases panel.
                                You can find all phrases there, and either enter translations for them, or export them as a spreadsheet to send to a translator, for subsequent import back into the panel.

                        Phrases are chunks of text, defined in plugin settings, Twig frameworks, and PHP program files.
                        They are originally in English as Zenario was developed in English, but you can create
                        translations of phrases into other languages.
                        When Zenario goes to display a phrase, it looks to see if a translation exists and displays
                        that if it can. Phrases are managed in the <em>Phrases</em> panel in Organizer.
