                            If your site has an extranet area, and a content item's permissions define it as private, this mode bypasses the permissions system and shows you how it will appear to an authorized user. Look out for coloured warning triangles over hyperlinks that indicate where something an administrator can see can't be seen by an anonymous visitor, or an extranet user.

                            Pages are called "content items", and they are version-controlled. When you start editing, Zenario makes a draft that you can work on without your changes being seen by visitors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Content items have slots, which contain plugins. These are colour-coded:<ul>
                            <li>Green slots are version-controlled, and any changes can be previewed before publishing</li>
                            <li>Pink slots are plugins on this content item (but a plugin can be used in more than one place)</li>
                            <li>Purple slots are plugins on the layout, so they appear on every content item using that layout.</li>
                            </ul>

                            The rectangular areas of a page are called "slots". A slot can a contain a plugin, a nests or a slideshow, or it can be empty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Plugins are instances of a Zenario module that a visitor can see. They can have a range of uses, from simple Banners (that have an image, words and a link) to those with custom functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A nest is a combination of multiple plugins arranged together. A slideshow is a combination of several Banner plugins to show an animated display.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can click the slot inspector in the top-right of a slot to access the settings of a plugin, nest or slideshow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The same plugin, nest or slideshow can be used in many places. So if you make changes, beware that the change may have effect on more than one content item.

                        <p>
                            Zenario's menu navigation is arranged into "menu sections", with "Main" being the name of the main one. There can be a footer menu, and others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On a simple site, each section may have a single "level", typically with a few menu nodes. But on larger sites each section can have a hierarchy with two or more levels of navigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can change the text of a menu node by just clicking on the text while in this mode. Changes take effect as soon as you save.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                    Menu nodes can have further properties: for example, they can link to external websites, they can have CSS classes and images, and on extranet sites they can have controls over when and to whom they appear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Normally just one menu node links to each content item. But it's possible to have several menu nodes linking to a content item, and in that situation one menu node is designated as "primary" and the others as "secondary".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The whole menu hierarchy, or tree, can be re-arranged, and to do this click "Organize menu".
                        </p>
