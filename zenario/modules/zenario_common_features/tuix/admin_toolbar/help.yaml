                            When a content item is published, this mode shows you how this content item appears to site visitors. If a draft exists, this mode shows you how the new version will appear when published.

                            If your site has an extranet area, and a content item's permissions define it as private, this mode bypasses the permissions system and shows you how it will appear to an authorized user.
