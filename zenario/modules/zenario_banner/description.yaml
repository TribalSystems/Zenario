    <p>Banners let you add text and images to your website, and are typically used for callouts or links to other pages.
        A Banner can be any combination of an image, a block of text and HTML, and a managed hyperlink.</p>
    
    <p>You may enter text for a banner by writing plain HTML, or by using a WYSIWYG Editor. If you have more than one language on your site and you place your
        Banner on the Layout or Template Family Layer, you also have the option of using Visitor Phrases to make your text multilingual.</p>
    
    <p>A Banner may display an image. You may also nominate a second image as a rollover.</p>
    
    <p>Images can be in JPG, PNG and GIF formats. In addition, the CMS can automatically resize large images down in size.</p>
    
    <p>Banners can link to a Content Item on your site, an image on your site, or a custom URL.</p>
    
    <p>If you link to a Content Item on your site, then this will form a managed link, which will be updated automatically if the alias to that Content Item
        ever changes, and will be deleted automatically if that Content Item is ever deleted.</p>
    
    <p>If you link to a document on your site, you will have the option of linking to its download page, or linking directly to the file download.</p>
    
    <p>If you link to an image on your site, then this image will appear in a floating box above the current page.
        Note that using or linking to an image gives the current Visitor the right to view that image at the size you specify.</p>
    
    <p>If you link to a Picture Content Item, you may use a resized version of that picture as the image for your Banner.
        This also allows you to have a Picture which is private (e.g. only available via some kind of subscription model),
        yet create a publicly visible thumbnail as a preview.</p>
        
    <p>Banners are nestable; this means that by first inserting a Plugin Nest into a Slot, you can then insert multiple Banners to make creative animated effects.</p>
