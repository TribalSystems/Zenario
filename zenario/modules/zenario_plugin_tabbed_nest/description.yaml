    <p>This Module allows you to set up and manage a collection of multiple Plugins in one Slot (which is called a Nest),
                    then display one-at-a-time to a visitor using a tabbed interface.</p>
                <p>Only one tab will be displayed to visitors at a time and different tabs will be loaded in via AJAX if a visitor clicks on them.</p>
                
                <p>Nests are managed using the Quick Admin Panel, which allows you to access Admin controls yet still see some of the page you are working on.</p>
                
                <p>To add a Plugin to a Nest you can either copy an existing plugin, or add a new plugin.</p>
                <p>Once in a Nest, Plugins can be re-ordered, and can be modified in much the same was as any other Plugin in a Slot.</p>
