        This module lets you build forms that are used by website visitors and extranet users.
    </p><p>
        In organizer under the forms panel, you can create a new form and edit existing ones. You're able to set how to form will behave
        on a web-page from it's properties. A form can log data from submissions, create and store data next to a user account, send emails to administrators and the user provided an email field is on the form and send a signal. After a forms been submitted, you can choose what happens next. The user can stay on the page with the form, be redirected to another page or show a success message when successfull. Forms also have the option of requiring a Captcha to be completed before it can be submitted.
    </p><p>
        Once a forms been created, form fields can be added and edited. A form field can be linked to a dataset field for a user, or be unlinked. An unlinked form field cannot be saved against a user, and can only be recorded in the submission log. Fields have a list of properties used to customize their functionality, including their label, whether to make it mandatory or read-only and many others.

        Once a form has been created, to place it on a page a new plugin needs to be created from the Forms module, and a form assigned to it in it's plugin settings

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
