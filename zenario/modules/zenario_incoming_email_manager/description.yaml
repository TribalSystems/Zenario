                    The Incoming Email Manager Module provides support for other Modules to receive and respond to or handle email.
                    It provides two different methods for reading emails: It can receive email that is directed to it from a forwarder,
                    or it can fetch email from a Mailbox via IMAP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An email forwarder is an email address that forwards every email it receives to a different email address,
                    or to a script. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you or your server administrator can create an email forwarder, and you set this to forward email to the script
                    provided by the Incoming Email Manager Module, then you can set up an email address which will pass any incoming
                    email that it receives to this Email Handler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your server administrator has enabled IMAP support
                    (see <a target="_blank" href="http://php.net/manual/en/imap.requirements.php">
                        http://php.net/manual/en/imap.requirements.php</a>),
                    the Incoming Email Manager can periodically connect to a mailbox to check for email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default the mailbox will be checked for new email every 5 minutes. However you may set Time,
                    Day and/or Month rules to adjust when the mailbox is to be checked, using similar controls to Scheduled Tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for other Modules to make use of the Incoming Email Manager functionality, they register an Incoming Email Manager Job
                    in their description.xml file. This tells the Incoming Email Manager to pass the incoming email's details to a given function in
                    their module_code.php file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the Incoming Email Manager has fetched an email and an Email Handler has processed it,
                    the email can be either deleted from the source mailbox, or moved to a different mailbox. Settings are provided
                    for you to move successfully processed emails to one mailbox and those that were not successfully processed to another mailbox.
                    This is useful for debugging and maintaining an accurate audit trail.
                </p>
                <p>
