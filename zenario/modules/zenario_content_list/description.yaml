    <p>
                This Module can show a list of Content Items from your website and you can choose from 
                any of the available content types.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the Content List Module you can easily view any content in one place with links to
                full content pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can manipulate the output using the many display options such as: restricting the 
                length of the preview, splitting long listings into many pages, selecting sections of 
                the content item to be shown in list view, manipulating the displayed date and times, 
                adding preview images, changing the ordering of the list, adding a feed of your list 
                using RSS, restricting the visibility of a content item to one or more user groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can restrict the displayed list to only some items grouped in specified category, or
                list all of the content items for a given content type.
            </p>
