    <p>
    Often called a "CSL", this powerful and frequently-used module makes plugins that automatically display a list of content items from your site, according to rules that you set.</p>
    Once a CSL plugin is set up, you can create other content items and it will display them automatically (you shouldn't need to change the CSL every time).</p>
    <p>
    A typical use of a CSL is as a news listing. For example, used on a home page, set its source content type to "News", and make it order results by "Release date".</p>
    <p>
    There are powerful filtering features, so that you may display things based on categories, either including or excluding based on the categorisation of content items.</p>
    <p>
    Another common use of a CSL is to automatically display content on a landing page, based on the content items beneath the current page in the menu hierarchy. Again the CSL works this out on the fly, so if you create a content item underneath the current one in the menu, the CSL will display it.</p>
    <p>On the "Each item" tab of this plugin, you can determine how each entry appears in the list. It's common to display the browser title, a short amount of text (usually from the Summary field); if listing News and other date-related things the release date can be displayed; and if the content items have images flagged as a feature image then the CSL will display that image as a thumbnail.</p>
