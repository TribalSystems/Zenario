description: |
    <p>This Module allows visitors to log in as Extranet Users.</p>
            <p>When you install this Module it will automatically create a Login page on your site.</p>
            <p>The default behaviour is to have just one Login page,
                however you may create a Login page for each Language on your site
                by creating translations of the original Login page in each Language.</p>
            <p>You may also use it to create other Login Boxes around your site,
                which will take visitors to the Login page when they enter their details,
                then return them to the page they were originally looking at after they successfully log in.</p>
            <p>This Module contains an option which will let an Extranet User keep themselves logged in almost indefinitely, if you enable it.
                This will keep them logged in until:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They logout.</li>
                <li>They clear their cookies.</li>
                <li>Their cookie expires (after about three months).</li>
                <li>The account is suspended by an Administrator.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While this Module only handles logging users in, it will automatically generate links to the Registration, Password Reminder,
                Change Password and Logout special pages if they are set up.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
