    <p>This Module allows you to set up and manage a collection of multiple Plugins inside the same Slot (which is called a Nest).</p>
                
                <p>Nests are managed using the Quick Admin Panel, which allows you to access Admin controls yet still see some of the page you are working on.</p>
                
                <p>To add a Plugin to a Nest you can either copy an existing plugin, or add a new Plugin.</p>
                <p>Once in a Nest, Plugins can be re-ordered, and can be modified in much the same was as any other Plugin in a Slot.</p>
                
                <p>Plugin Nests can also be tabbed. If you create multiple tabs in a Nest, Plugins in the Nest can then be organised within the different tab-groups.
                    Only one tab will be displayed to visitors at a time and different tabs will be loaded in via AJAX if a visitor clicks on them.</p>
                
                <p>The Flexible Nest adds functionality to show any number of Plugins on a Tab rather than just one,
                    and to hide/show tab-groups based on one of the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whether a User is logged in</li>
                    <li>Whether a User is or is not a member of a given Group</li>
                    <li>Whether a User has or has not a given Characteristic</li>
                    <li>Whether a visitor is logged out</li>
                    <li>Whether a visitor is logged out or is not a member of a given Group</li>
                    <li>Whether a visitor is logged out or has not a given Characteristic</li>
                    <li>Whether a call to a Module's static method returns true</li>
                </ul>
