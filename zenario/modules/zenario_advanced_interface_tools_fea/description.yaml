# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.

# Conductor uses paths between slides to control its navigation.
# When creating a path, the admin can specify a command for that path. The path will then be followed
# when your plugin issues this command.
# You should define the command that your plugin uses below. For each command, you should give it a
# label, and list which modes it's used in (no list means every mode), and the request_vars it uses.
# Note that you will need to increment the LATEST_REVISION_NO in this module's latest_revision_no.inc.php file
# every time you add or change the request_vars or hierarchical_var properties, to have them re-read by the CMS.
