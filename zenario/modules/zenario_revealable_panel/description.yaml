                <p>This Module allows you to create hidden panels on your webpage. Any Plugin that can be placed in a Nest can be placed in a hidden panel.</p>
                
                <p>Hidden panels are managed using the Quick Admin Panel, which allows you to access Admin controls yet still see some of the page you are working on.</p>
                
                <p>To add a Plugin to a hidden panel you can either copy an existing plugin, or add a new plugin.</p>
                <p>Once in a hidden panel, Plugins can be re-ordered, and can be modified in much the same was as any other Plugin in a Slot.</p>
                
                <p>Each hidden panel is linked to a tab which is always visible.
                    You can make it so that the panel appears when a visitor clicks on its tab,
                    or alternately so that the panel appears when a visitor moves their mouse over its tab.</p>
                <p>The panels appear next to the tab that opened them. Where exactly they appear depends
                    on the CSS in the Skin or the Swatch that is used.</p>
                
                <p>You make choose between three different effects for revealing panels, None, Fade or Slide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        None causes the Panel to appear and disappear instantly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fade causes the Panel to fade in and out smoothly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slide causes the Panel to appear and disappear by sliding up and down from the top.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This Module requires your visitors to have JavaScript enabled to use all of the options and effects.
                    However if a visitor does not have JavaScript enabled then this Module will degrade gracefully and fall back
                    on settings that do work without JavaScript.</p>
