description: |
                    <p>Displays a portion of the hierarchical menu of your Zenario website, using a vertical list. This is designed to be used as a side menu.</p>
    
                    <p>This Module can generate different types of menu, including "popout" menus (which appear upon mouseover).</p>
    
                    <p>The navigation bar is vertically arranged; for a horizontal navigation bar, use the Menu (Horizontal) Plugin.</p>
    
                    <p>It supports a change of style (e.g. colour) of a Menu Node when a user's mouse is hovering over that Menu Node. It also supports the display of an indication of the visitor's current location.</p>
    
                    <p>In Administration Mode the generated menu contains "Add a Menu Node here" icons, which help an Author rapidly expand and develop a web site.</p>
    
                    <p>It also supports displaying the menu hierarchy from any of 7 different levels - from Levels 1 to 5, and two levels that are relative to the current Content Item.</p>
    
                    <p>It supports multiple Menu Sections if you have Zenario Pro, providing support for different menu trees.</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
