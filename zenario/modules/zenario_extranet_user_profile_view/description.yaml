description: |
    <p>This Module enables you to display the profile of a given User to visitors.</p>
            <p>The User whose profile you wish to display can be chosen in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can chose a specific User by using a Plugin setting</li>
                <li>The User can be looked up by seeing if the page on which the Plugin is placed is associated with a User. This enables you to place the Plugin in the Layout Layer for a more maintainable solution.</li>
            </ul>
