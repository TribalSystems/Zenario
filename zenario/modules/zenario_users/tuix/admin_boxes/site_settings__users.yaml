                        For sites with social features such as comments and forums, logged-in users will have a screen name, the name which will appear when they post something.
                        If you enable this setting, the Extranet Registration module will prompt new users to choose a screen name when registering, and the Extranet
                        Login Module will have the option to allow users to log in using their screen name (rather than an email address).
