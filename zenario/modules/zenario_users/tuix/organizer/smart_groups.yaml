                            Smart groups are views of user/contact records that you can define. When creating a smart group, you define criteria based on fields on the user/contact data record, such as groups and checkbox flags.
                            
                            If you are using the Newsletter system to send mass emails, you should create a smart group for each mailing list you would like to send to.
