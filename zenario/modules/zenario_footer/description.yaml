description: |
    <p>An essential Module to add a footer containing single-level navigation to your site.</p>
            
            <p>Displays links at a single level within a single Language and Section of your menu hierarchy.</p>
            
            <p>We recommend you insert this Module into a Slot near the foot of your Template file, and apply across an entire Template Family.</p>
            
            <p>This Module supports multiple Menu Sections if you have Zenario Pro.
                For example, instead of the "Footer" Section you could have Footer Pro display from a different Section which you create,
                such as "Corporate".</p>
