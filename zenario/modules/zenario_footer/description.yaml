    <p>An essential Module to add a footer containing single-level navigation to your site.</p>
            
            <p>Displays links at a single level within a single Language and Section of your menu hierarchy.</p>
            
            <p>We recommend you insert this Module into a Slot near the foot of your Template file, and apply across an entire Template Family.</p>
            
            <p>This Module supports multiple Menu Sections if you have Zenario Pro.
                For example, instead of the "Footer" Section you could have Footer Pro display from a different Section which you create,
                such as "Corporate".</p>

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
