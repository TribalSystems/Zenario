                This plugin generates navigation links which are related to the menu hierarchy, and can 
                point to the successor, predecessor or parent of currently viewed page. We recommend you
                use this plugin to navigate though sections of ebooks, courses and other content that 
                can be split into menu nodes.

# Warning: adding a new dependency to an existing module will break any existing sites
# where the dependency is not running.
# You can fix this on a per-site basis by manually running the dependency, i.e. by running
#   UPDATE zenario_modules SET status = 'module_running' WHERE class_name = 'dependency'
# in MySQL and then going to /admin/ to apply database updates.
# If this is a core module, consider using runNewModuleDependency() in a 
# database-revision in zenario/admin/db_updates/step_4_migrate_the_data/plugins.inc.php
# to fix it automatically for every site.
