    <p>This Module lets you set up and Manage Forums (message boards) on your website.</p>
            <p>Visitors will be able to read threads (topics), create new threads and reply to them.</p>
            <p>The Posts editor is equipped with a rich text editor, the features of which can be enabled or
                disabled in this Module's settings.</p>
            <p>You can restrict posting privileges to Extranet Users, or Users of selected Group(s).
                You can allow users to modify and/or delete their own posts and report an offensive comment.</p>
            <p>There are also moderation tools for members of Employee-type Groups, allowing them to edit
                or remove offending messages.</p>
            <p>When setting up, you can select the information that should be displayed about the people who post:
                name, online status, post count, sign-up date, job titles and avatars.</p>
            <p>Every time a new thread or message is created or an existing message is edited, an email notification can be set to a specified
                email address (typically the Forum/Website administrator). You can create and select your own Email
                Templates and these will be used to send the reports. The selected Email Templates can contain various
                Merge Fields that will be replaced by real values when the email is sent. You can use the following
                fields in the Emails sent by the Forum Module:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[cms_url]] - The URL to the website.</li>
                <li>[[forum_link]] - A link to the page that Forum is on.</li>
                <li>[[forum_title]] - The title of the Forum (this is the same as the page title).</li>
                <li>[[message]] - The message that was just created or edited.</li>
                <li>[[thread_link]] - A link to the thread that was just created or replied to.</li>
                <li>[[thread_title]] - The title of the thread that was just created or replied to.</li>
                <li>[[poster_screen_name]] - The Screen Name of the Extranet User who posted the message.
                    (Note that this will only appear if Screen Names are enabled in the Site Settings.)</li>
                <li>[[poster_username]] - The Username of the Extranet User who posted the message.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the subscription feature is enabled, Extranet Users can subscribed to a thread to receive notifications
                of any new replies made there, or subscribe to a Forum and receive notifications of any new threads created there.
                Each subscriber will be sent an email when a reply/thread is posted.
                These emails also use an Email Template, in which you can use any of the fields above (except for
                [[poster_username]] as Usernames are private), and in addition the following fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[[subscriber_email]] - The email of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_title]] - The title of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_first_name]] - The first name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_middle_name]] - The middle name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_last_name]] - The last name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_screen_name]] - The Screen Name of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
                <li>[[subscriber_username]] - The Username of the subscribing Extranet User.</li>
