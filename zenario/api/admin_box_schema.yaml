                        If opening an Admin Box from Organizer, this should match up with the
                        id of an Item in the current Panel. If you open the Admin Box using an
                        Item Button in Organizer, this will be automatically populated.
                        
                        If you are saving a newly created Item, you should populate the id
                        yourself as soon as you know what it is.

                If you only have one tab, you may wish to hide the tab bar to reduce
                clutter and/or to gain a little bit of extra space.
        
        max_height:

        shake:

            modified_by_cms: true
            description: >
                If there are errors on a tab, the CMS will give the Admin Box a little
                shake when the Admin tries to submit it.
                However if you wish to specifically enable or disable the shaking, you can
                set this property.
                The CMS will clear this property and go back to its default behaviour every time
                the Admin Box is validated and formatted.

        save_button_message:

                The message on the save button.
            default: Save
        
        cancel_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                Including this property will remove the close button at the top right of the box
                and add a "cancel" button with the specified message at the bottom next to
                the "save" button.
        
        save_and_continue_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                Including this property will add a "Save and Continue" button to the Admin Box.
                This button acts in the same way as the save button, except that it does
                not close the Admin Box afterwards.
                
                This means that the Admin Box may be saved more than one time, and it also
                means that an Admin Box may start out creating a new thing, but then switch
                to editing an existing thing.
                
                The "Save and Continue" option probably works best when an Admin is
                editing something that already exists. You can enable it when in "Create"
                mode, but you will probably need to reformat the Admin Box when the Admin
                first saves and the thing you are creating is saved in the database.
                
                If the change between creating a new thing and editing an existing thing
                is too drastic, or will cause problems, you should not enable the "Save
                and Continue" option in "Create" mode.

                                                Setting it will start the Admin out in the "By Language" Panel, under the

                                                Setting it will turn that picker into an Equivalence picker; i.e. you're not
                                                selecting a specific Content Item, but instead you're picking that Content Item

                                                If this property is set, you can pass any Content ID and Type in as a value for this
                                                field, and the CMS will automatically show the Admin the appropriate
                                                translation based upon the language that they are currently editing.

                                            <p>There are two types of button field available in the Admin Box toolkit (submit buttons and toggle buttons), which can be pressed by an Administrator. If an&nbsp;Administrator presses a button then the <code>pressed</code> boolean property will be set to true.</p>
                                            <h2>Submit Buttons</h2>
                                            <p>The 'submit' type buttons act as if they always have the <code>validate_onchange</code> property set; when they are pressed&nbsp;the client will change the value of the <code>pressed</code> property to true, then call the validation function.</p>
                                            <p>When the field is next redrawn after the validation, the client then automatically unsets the <code>pressed</code> property.</p>
                                            <p>Note that this will only ever submit your admin box for validation,and never for saving.The 'save' button at the bottom of the box should be used to submit for saving.</p>
                                            <h2>Toggle Buttons</h2>
                                            <p>For 'toggle' type buttons, the client will toggle the value of <code>pressed</code> between false and true each time the Admin presses this button.</p>
                                            <p>Before Zenario&nbsp;version 6.0.4,&nbsp;'toggle' type buttons acted as if they always had the&nbsp;<code>format_onchange</code> property set; when they were pressed the client changed the value of the <code>pressed</code> property, then called the format function.</p>
                                            <p>From version 6.0.4 and onwards, you must add either the&nbsp;<code>redraw_onchange</code>,&nbsp;<code>format_onchange</code>,&nbsp;<code>validate_onchange</code> or <code>quick_validate_onchange</code> properties to make a&nbsp;<code>span</code>'toggle' type button to do something when the Admin presses it.</span></p>
                                            <h2>PHP Good Practice</h2>
                                            <p>As the value of the <code>pressed</code> may not be set in PHP, you should check it using <code>!empty()</code>, <code>isset()</code>, <code>arrayKey()</code>, <code>issetArrayKey()</code> or a similar function to avoid a PHP warning.</p>
