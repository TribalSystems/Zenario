                (The toolkit will consider that you are editing an existing record if the $box['key']['id']
                 variable is set.)
                
                You can also use merge fields, e.g.: Editing the animal "[[details/name]]".

                        If you are saving a newly created Item, you should populate the id

            description: >
                If you set this property, the tab bar will not be visible.
                If you only have one tab, you may wish to hide the tab bar to reduce
                clutter and/or to gain a little bit of extra space.
        
        max_height:
            type: integer
            description: >
                Include this property to set a maximum height (in pixels) for the box.

        shake:
            type: boolean
            modified_by_cms: true
            description: >
                If there are errors on a tab, the CMS will give the Admin Box a little
                shake when the Admin tries to submit it.
                However if you wish to specifically enable or disable the shaking, you can
                set this property.
                The CMS will clear this property and go back to its default behaviour every time
                the Admin Box is validated and formatted.
        
        css_class:
            type: string

        save_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                The message on the save button.
            default: Save
        
        cancel_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                Including this property will remove the close button at the top right of the box
                and add a "cancel" button with the specified message at the bottom next to
                the "save" button.
        
        save_and_continue_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                Including this property will add a "Save and Continue" button to the Admin Box.
                This button acts in the same way as the save button, except that it does
                not close the Admin Box afterwards.
                
                This means that the Admin Box may be saved more than one time, and it also
                means that an Admin Box may start out creating a new thing, but then switch
                to editing an existing thing.
                
                The "Save and Continue" option probably works best when an Admin is
                editing something that already exists. You can enable it when in "Create"
                mode, but you will probably need to reformat the Admin Box when the Admin
                first saves and the thing you are creating is saved in the database.
                
                If the change between creating a new thing and editing an existing thing
                is too drastic, or will cause problems, you should not enable the "Save
                and Continue" option in "Create" mode.
        
        extra_button_html:
            type: string
            description: >
                You can use this property to add some extra html after the save button.
                
                
                This works from version 7.1 onwards.

            html_description: |
                <p>You can set this for your Admin Box to offer a file download upon completion.</p>
                <p>Setting the <code>download</code> property for an Admin Box will cause the CMS to call your <code>adminBoxDownload()</code> method as well as your <code>saveAdminBox()</code> method when the Admin Box is saved.</p>
                <p>You should handle this request by outputting the appropriate headers and then outputting a file.</p>

                in order to customise the message.
                
                Note that this will clash with the <code>popout_message</code> property in Organizer;
                you can use one or the other, but not both at the same time.
        
        toast:

                            This is usually convenient, but can cause problems for tabs with scrollbars
                            as the browser will scroll to show the focused field.

                                        The name property is used for <code>type: grouping</code> and
                                        <code>type: radio</code> fields.
                                        
                                        
                                        If you have multiple <code>type: radio</code> fields on one tab, you can bind them together into
                                        a radiogroup by giving them all the same name, e.g. <code>name: my_radiogroup</code>.
                                        
                                        
                                        To create a grouping, you can make a field with <code>type: grouping</code> and
                                        give it a name, e.g. <code>name: my_grouping_name</code>
                                        
                                        You can put fields in the grouping by adding the <code>grouping</code> property to
                                        them, e.g. <code>grouping: my_grouping_name</code>
                                        
                                        
                                        This works from version 7.1 onwards.

If an&nbsp;Administrator presses a button then the <code>pressed</code> boolean property will be set to true.</p>

                                        <p>The 'submit' type buttons act as if they always have the <code>validate_onchange</code> property set; when they are pressed&nbsp;the client will change the value of the <code>pressed</code> property to true, then call the validation function.</p>
                                        <p>When the field is next redrawn after the validation, the client then automatically unsets the <code>pressed</code> property.</p>
                                        <p>Note that this will only ever submit your admin box for validation,and never for saving.The 'save' button at the bottom of the box should be used to submit for saving.</p>
                                        <h2>Toggle Buttons</h2>
                                        <p>For 'toggle' type buttons, the client will toggle the value of <code>pressed</code> between false and true each time the Admin presses this button.</p>
                                        <p>Before Zenario&nbsp;version 6.0.4,&nbsp;'toggle' type buttons acted as if they always had the&nbsp;<code>format_onchange</code> property set; when they were pressed the client changed the value of the <code>pressed</code> property, then called the format function.</p>
                                        <p>From version 6.0.4 and onwards, you must add either the&nbsp;<code>redraw_onchange</code>,&nbsp;<code>format_onchange</code>,&nbsp;<code>validate_onchange</code> or <code>quick_validate_onchange</code> properties to make a&nbsp;<code>span</code>'toggle' type button to do something when the Admin presses it.</span></p>

                                        <p>As the value of the <code>pressed</code> may not be set in PHP, you should check it using <code>!empty()</code>, <code>isset()</code>, <code>arrayKey()</code>, <code>issetArrayKey()</code> or a similar function to avoid a PHP warning.</p>

                                        The syntax for the picker is similar to that for a pick items field, except that you must ensure

                                        The HTML editor fields are implemented using the TinyMCE library.
                                        If you need to set any custom options then you can pass them in here.
                                        
                                        Some intelligent defaults are set, depending on whether the field is
                                        readonly, and whether the insert_image_button or insert_link_button
                                        properties are set.
                                        
                                        
                                        This works from version 7.0.6 onwards.
