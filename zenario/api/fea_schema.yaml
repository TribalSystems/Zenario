    css_class: &css_class

        show_by_default_in_editor: true
        description: A CSS class name to add to this element.
    ord: &ord
        type: *stringy
        description: >
            This controls the order in which elements are drawn on the screen.
            
            If not set, it defaults to the order the CMS finds them in.
            
            If you are inserting elements into another module's TUIX,
            you can use syntax of the form "name_of_other_element.001"
            to place an element after the named element in the order.
    copy_of: &copy_of
        type: string
        description: >
            You can enter the code-name of another element (this must be element with the same
            parent element) to copy the properties from.
            
            Any other properties you set will override the copied properties.
            
            If the element that you are attempting to copy is missing, unset, or not yet loaded,
            then your element will be removed.
            
            This works from version 8.0 onwards.

            From version 7.5 onwards, to avoid using an inefficent eval(), you can also call a function
            by using an object of the form:
                lib.methodName => arg1, arg2, arg3, ...
            
            The visible_if property hides elements from view if the code provided does not evaluate to <code>true</code>.

                                        e.g. from a typahead search.

                                                This is useful if you wish to have a type-ahead that helps users pick
                                                existing things, but also be able to create something new by typing a
