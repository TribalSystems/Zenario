                                    If the specified parent does not exist in the data then an item will also be
                                    considered to be a top-level item.
                            
                                    Setting this property will completely disable grid and list view. Instead
                                    Organizer will show in hierarchy view.

                                        Setting a Title for a Column makes it visible to the Admin in List Views, as well as in the Column Picker.

                                        Each table should be given its own unique alias, but you should not give

                                        Together with the <code>title</code> property, the <code>server_side_only</code> property controls when
                                        data in a column is sent to a client.
                                
                                        Setting the <code>server_side_only</code> property and not setting a <code>title</code> will ensure
                                        that the data in a column is never sent to the client.
                                        Setting the <code>server_side_only</code> property and a <code>title</code> will make a column only
                                        visible in a CSV Export.
                                        Not setting the <code>server_side_only</code> property or a <code>title</code> will send a column's
                                        data to the client; the data will not be visible as a column but can still
                                        be used by confirm messages, label properties, and so on.
                                
                                        Note that the column's definition will always be sent to the client.

                                        A refiner is a SQL snippet that will be added to the WHERE statement if
                                        enabled, and can be used to refiner the results in some additional way.
                                
                                        For example:
                                            t.some_column_name IS NOT NULL
                                
                                        Refiners that were called from an item-level action will set the item id in
                                        a constant which you can reference, for example:
                                            t.some_column_name = [[REFINER_ID]]
                                
                                        Or if multiple selection was enabled, another constant can be used:
                                            t.some_column_name IN [[REFINER_IDS]]
                                
                                        Refiners will only work with panels with a <code>db_items</code> property

                                        This means two things. Firstly, if an Admin makes any changes to their view
                                        options on a panel using this refiner, the saved options will be stored
                                        against this refiner rather than against the panel as is normally the case.
                                
                                        Secondly, it means that you can change the value of the <code>view_mode</code> property
                                        (for panels) or the <code>always_show</code> or <code>show_by_default</code> properties (for columns)
                                        in your PHP methods when this refiner is active, and have the changes only
                                        affect the view options for this refiner.

                                        This works in the same way as the <code>use_different_view_options</code> property, except
                                        that the view options will differ again for each different value of this

                                        You should only use this option when a refiner has only a few possible
                                        values, otherwise it will create a lot of clutter in an Admin's Organizer
                                        preferences.

                            The message won't trigger a second time if an admin refreshes the panel, or
                            navigates to the panel using the back button.

                            You can use all of the features from http://zenar.io/customising-popout-messages-in-admin-mode
                            in order to customise the message.
                    
                            Note that this will clash with the <code>popout_message</code> property for Admin Boxes;
                            you can use one or the other, but not both at the same time.

                                        This property allows you to open a Pop-out window when an Admin clicks on your button.
                                        A typical usage would be to display a bigger version of an image or movie.
                                
                                        This is implemented using the Colorbox library.

                                        be added onto the end of the URL specified in the <code>href</code> property as requests.

    <p>Organizer is built on static YAML files, written in the zenario User Interface Language (TUIX), which describe and give structure to its sections and Panels.</p>
    <p>Organizer Apps, which are zenario Modules, are written in the same language and using the same schema as Organizer - which is an App itself.</p>
    <p>In order to add functionality to Organizer, your Module must contain one or more YAML files in its&nbsp;<code>tuix/organizer&nbsp;</code>subdirectory.
        (There is no need to have multiple files, but if your App has multiple sections we would recommend that you create one file per section.)</p>
    <p>The YAML files serve as a map or plan of what functionality your Plugin adds to Organizer, and where.</p>
    <p>For example, a YAML property may define the buttons which are added to Organizer, or the top level links that appear at the left hand-side.</p>
    <p>When developing Organizer Apps, the flow of the Schema is one-way. Your YAML files are read by the CMS on the server and turned into a PHP array, which then passes them to the client as JSON. The client does not pass the JSON object back, but instead replies using <code>GET</code> or&nbsp;<code>POST</code> AJAX requests.</p>
    <h2>The top level items</h2>
    <p>The first things in the Organizer Schema are the top level items. These add links to the left-hand panel in Organizer.</p>
    <p>Note that if you wish to include functionality in Organizer you must either create a top level item to contain it, or to place your functionality within another Module's top level item.</p>
