            This controls the order in which elements are drawn on the screen.
            
            If not set, it defaults to the order the CMS finds them in.
            
            If you are inserting elements into another module's TUIX,
            you can use syntax of the form "name_of_other_element.001"
            to place an element after the named element in the order.
    copy_of: &copy_of
        type: string
        description: >
            You can enter the code-name of another element (this must be element with the same
            parent element) to copy the properties from.
            
            Any other properties you set will override the copied properties.
            
            If the element that you are attempting to copy is missing, unset, or not yet loaded,
            then your element will be removed.
            
            This works from version 8.0 onwards.

            by using an object of the form:

                You should set this property to either form or list, depending on which type of FEA plugin
                you are writing.
                
                You must set this, otherwise your FEA plugin will not do anything.
                
                This property must be written in your .yaml file.
                It can't be changed in php.

                 variable is set.)
                
                You can also use merge fields, e.g.: Editing the animal "[[name]]".

                If you want two levels of grouping, then you can define some outer-groupings,
                which wrap-around and group the normal groupings.
                
                Again this affects the sorting - items will be sorted by their outer-grouping first,
                then their grouping, then their normal sort order.

                You can use this to add a google map to a list plugin.
                For this to work, each item should have a latitude and longitude set,
                and you need a framework with <div>s roughly as follows:
                
                    <div id="map_{{containerId|e}}" style="height: 400px;"></div>
                    <div id="info_{{containerId|e}}" style="display: none;">
                        <div id="fea_{{containerId|e}}"></div>
                    </div>
                
                This will cause the normal list to be hidden, the items to appear on the map as pins,
                and the fulld details for each item to appear when you click the pins.

                                    For example, you might have a plugin that usually lists

                                    You might sometimes need to show an assert instead, and
                                    need to override the idVarName and set it to "assetId".

                This property allows you to trigger navigation in TUIX forms.
                It is ignored when the form is first displayed, but will be followed when
                the form is re-displayed (e.g. because the user pressed the save button).
        
        js_after:
            type:
                - string
                - object
            description: >
                Runs some JavaScript code after the FEA is displayed or redisplayed,
                or after the navigation logic is finished if you just navigated away
                using the go property.
                
                The format is the same as the visible_if property.

                This object, and any child objects and properties, will always be synced between the client
                and the server.
                
                To help make TUIX forms and applications secure, and to make it harder for a developer to
                unwittingly introduce security vulnerabilities in their code, only a few TUIX properties
                that have a specific purpose can be synced between the client and the server.
                
                This object is provided as a free-for-all exception, so anyone making a custom application
                can add anything they need synced in here.
        
        missing_items_warning:
            type: string
            description: >
                The form toolkit will not display selected values for checkboxes, radios or select lists
                that are not in the provided LOV.
                
                It will also not save these values.
                
                If you want to enable a warning when this is about to happen, you can enable it by adding
                some text to this property, e.g. "Warning: ID [[items]] missing, save settings to clean up."
                
                This works from version 8.8 onwards.
