            This controls the order in which elements are drawn on the screen.
            
            If not set, it defaults to the order the CMS finds them in.
            
            From version 7.3 onwards, if you are inserting elements into another module's TUIX,
            you can use syntax of the form "name_of_other_element.001"
            to place an element after the named element in the order.
    copy_of: &copy_of
        type: string
        description: >
            You can enter the code-name of another element (this must be element with the same
            parent element) to copy the properties from.
            
            Any other properties you set will override the copied properties.
            
            If the element that you are attempting to copy is missing, unset, or not yet loaded,
            then your element will be removed.
            
            This works from version 8.0 onwards.
    hidden: &hidden
        type: boolean
        description: >
            The hidden property hides elements from view when <code>true</code>.

        type:
            - string
            - object
        description: >
            A snippet of JavaScript code to be evaluated.
            
            From version 7.5 onwards, to avoid using an inefficent eval(), you can also call a function
            by using an object of the form:
                lib.methodName => arg1, arg2, arg3, ...
            
            The visible_if property hides elements from view if the code provided does not evaluate to <code>true</code>.
            
            See https://zenar.io/visibility-in-tuix for examples.

                If you set this property, it will be used instead of the title when editing an existing record.
                
                (The toolkit will consider that you are editing an existing record if the $box['key']['id']
                 variable is set.)
                
                You can also use merge fields, e.g.: Editing the animal "[[details/name]]".
                
                
                This works from version 7.2 onwards.

                        id of an Item in the current Panel. If you open the Admin Box using an
                        Item Button in Organizer, this will be automatically populated.
                        
                        If you are saving a newly created Item, you should populate the id

                It defaults to the first tab in the Admin Box, but this can be overridden
                by the developer who opened this Admin Box.

                If the user clicks on a tab, this property will be set to the code-name of the tab
                they just clicked on.
                
                Note: if there were any validation errors on the current tab,
                the switch will be cancelled and the current tab will be remain in view.
                
                
                This works from version 7.7 onwards.
        
        disable_selecting_tab_from_url:
            type: boolean
            description: >
                This allows you to disable the feature where a FAB can be opened on a specific
                tab by requesting it in the URL.
                
                You would want to do this if you are making a multi-step wizard, and
                want to make sure that users always start on step 1 when the wizard
                is opened.
                
                This works from version 9.0 onwards.
        
        hide_tab_bar:
            type: boolean
            description: >
                If you set this property, the tab bar will not be visible.
                If you only have one tab, you may wish to hide the tab bar to reduce
                clutter and/or to gain a little bit of extra space.
        
        max_height:

        shake:

            modified_by_cms: true
            description: >
                If there are errors on a tab, the CMS will give the Admin Box a little
                shake when the Admin tries to submit it.
                However if you wish to specifically enable or disable the shaking, you can
                set this property.
                The CMS will clear this property and go back to its default behaviour every time
                the Admin Box is validated and formatted.
        
        css_class:
            type: string
            description: A CSS class name to add to the outer wrapper of the Admin Box.
        
        save_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                The message on the save button.
            default: Save
        
        cancel_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                Including this property will remove the close button at the top right of the box
                and add a "cancel" button with the specified message at the bottom next to
                the "save" button.
        
        error_on_form_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                A message to display at the top of the screen when there is an error
                attached to a specific field on the form.
                
                A generic message will be used if one isn't provided here.
                
                This works from version 8.0 onwards.
        
        save_and_continue_button_message:
            type: string
            description: >
                Including this property will add a "Save and Continue" button to the Admin Box.
                This button acts in the same way as the save button, except that it does
                not close the Admin Box afterwards.
                
                This means that the Admin Box may be saved more than one time, and it also
                means that an Admin Box may start out creating a new thing, but then switch
                to editing an existing thing.
                
                The "Save and Continue" option probably works best when an Admin is
                editing something that already exists. You can enable it when in "Create"
                mode, but you will probably need to reformat the Admin Box when the Admin
                first saves and the thing you are creating is saved in the database.
                
                If the change between creating a new thing and editing an existing thing
                is too drastic, or will cause problems, you should not enable the "Save
                and Continue" option in "Create" mode.
        
        extra_button_html:
            type: string
            description: >
                You can use this property to add some extra html after the save button.
                
                
                This works from version 7.1 onwards.

            html_description: |
                <p>You can set this for your Admin Box to offer a file download upon completion.</p>
                <p>Setting the <code>download</code> property for an Admin Box will cause the CMS to call your <code>adminBoxDownload()</code> method as well as your <code>saveAdminBox()</code> method when the Admin Box is saved.</p>

                in order to customise the message.
                
                Note: this will clash with the <code>popout_message</code> property in Organizer;
                you can use one or the other, but not both at the same time.

                Admin Boxes are divided up into sections called "Tabs".
                
                Your Admin Box must have at least one tab, but can have multiple tabs.
                
                To place fields on your Admin Box, you must create at least one tab to put them on.

                            This is usually convenient, but can cause problems for tabs with scrollbars
                            as the browser will scroll to show the focused field.

                                                will still show the back button.

                                        This will only work properly if the ReCAPTURE library is already included on the
                                        page, and the sitekey and secret key are set correctly in the site settings.
                                        
                                        When the user correctly completes the CAPTURE, their successful responce will be stored
                                        in this field's value.
                                        
                                        Any unsuccessful responces, or responces that are not verified, will be stripped out.
                                        So if you see a value in this field in your PHP code, then you can be sure that the
                                        CAPTURE was successfully completed.

If an&nbsp;Administrator presses a button then the <code>pressed</code> boolean property will be set to true.</p>

                                        <p>The 'submit' type buttons act as if they always have the <code>validate_onchange</code> property set; when they are pressed&nbsp;the client will change the value of the <code>pressed</code> property to true, then call the validation function.</p>
                                        <p>When the field is next redrawn after the validation, the client then automatically unsets the <code>pressed</code> property.</p>
                                        <p>Be aware that this will only ever submit your admin box for validation,and never for saving.The 'save' button at the bottom of the box should be used to submit for saving.</p>
                                        <h2>Toggle Buttons</h2>
                                        <p>For 'toggle' type buttons, the client will toggle the value of <code>pressed</code> between false and true each time the Admin presses this button.</p>
                                        <p>Before Zenario&nbsp;version 6.0.4,&nbsp;'toggle' type buttons acted as if they always had the&nbsp;<code>format_onchange</code> property set; when they were pressed the client changed the value of the <code>pressed</code> property, then called the format function.</p>
                                        <p>From version 6.0.4 and onwards, you must add either the&nbsp;<code>redraw_onchange</code>,&nbsp;<code>format_onchange</code>,&nbsp;<code>validate_onchange</code> or <code>quick_validate_onchange</code> properties to make a&nbsp;<code>span</code>'toggle' type button to do something when the Admin presses it.</span></p>

                                        <p>As the value of the <code>pressed</code> may not be set in PHP, you should check it using <code>!empty()</code>, <code>isset()</code>, <code>arrayKey()</code>, <code>issetArrayKey()</code> or a similar function to avoid a PHP warning.</p>

                                        If you create a code_editor type field, you can set the language to enable syntax-highlighting.
                                        
                                        E.g. html, css, javascript, twig...
                                        
                                        You can also enter a filename to auto-detect the language from the extension.
                                        
                                        The Ace Editor (http://ace.c9.io/) is used to power these fields, and the language can be any
                                        language that Ace supports.

                From 7.0.7 onwards, instead of defining a list of values against each field,
                you can define lists of values here and just enter the code-name for each field.

                    This property is used in the installer and in wizards. If set, the installer
                    or the wizard will close and navigate to the specified path or URL.

                    When defining your module's plugin settings, you will need to set this
                    property in your .yaml file to indicate that the tabs and fields inside this file

                This object, and any child objects and properties, will always be synced between the client
                and the server.
                
                To help make TUIX forms and applications secure, and to make it harder for a developer to
                unwittingly introduce security vulnerabilities in their code, only a few TUIX properties
                that have a specific purpose can be synced between the client and the server.
                
                This object is provided as a free-for-all exception, so anyone making a custom application
                can add anything they need synced in here.

                The form toolkit will not display selected values for checkboxes, radios or select lists
                that are not in the provided LOV.
                
                It will also not save these values.
                
                If you want to enable a warning when this is about to happen, you can enable it by adding
                some text to this property, e.g. "Warning: ID [[items]] missing, save settings to clean up."
                
                This works from version 8.8 onwards.
