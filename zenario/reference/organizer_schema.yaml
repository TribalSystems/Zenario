            This controls the order in which elements are drawn on the screen.
            
            If not set, it defaults to the order the CMS finds them in.
            
            From version 7.3 onwards, if you are inserting elements into another module's TUIX,
            you can use syntax of the form "name_of_other_element.001"
            to place an element after the named element in the order.
    copy_of: &copy_of
        type: string

            You can enter the code-name of another element (this must be element with the same
            parent element) to copy the properties from.
            
            Any other properties you set will override the copied properties.
            
            If the element that you are attempting to copy is missing, unset, or not yet loaded,
            then your element will be removed.

                                        Together with the <code>title</code> property, the <code>server_side_only</code> property controls when

                                        Setting the <code>server_side_only</code> property and not setting a <code>title</code> will ensure

                                        Setting the <code>server_side_only</code> property and a <code>title</code> will make a column only
                                        visible in a CSV Export.
                                        Not setting the <code>server_side_only</code> property or a <code>title</code> will send a column's
                                        data to the client; the data will not be visible as a column but can still
                                        be used by confirm messages, label properties, and so on.
                                
                                        Note: the column's definition will always be sent to the client.

                                        A refiner is a SQL snippet that will be added to the WHERE statement if
                                        enabled, and can be used to refiner the results in some additional way.
                                
                                        For example:
                                            t.some_column_name IS NOT NULL
                                
                                        Refiners that were called from an item-level action will set the item id in
                                        a constant which you can reference, for example:
                                            t.some_column_name = [[REFINER_ID]]
                                
                                        Or if multiple selection was enabled, another constant can be used:
                                            t.some_column_name IN [[REFINER_IDS]]
                                
                                        Refiners will only work with panels with a <code>db_items</code> property

                                        This works from version 7.5 onwards.

                                        The "hierarchy_with_lazy_load" panel type shows hierarchy mode normally,

                                        set this property.

                                        From 8.4 onwards, you can use line breaks in "no items" messages to improve readability.

                            You can use all of the features from http://zenar.io/customising-popout-messages-in-admin-mode
                            in order to customise the message.
                    
                            Note: this will clash with the <code>popout_message</code> property for Admin Boxes;
                            you can use one or the other, but not both at the same time.

                                                Setting this option will allow an Admin to pick multiple values.
                                                They will be stored as comma-separated values.

                                                A phrase for the choose button then multiple items are selected.

                                                Setting this property will allow an Admin to press the "choose" button without
                                                anything selected.
                                        
                                                You would use this option if you wanted them to select a location or a refiner
                                                in Organizer rather than an item specifically; you can check the variables
                                                set in the POST request to see which refiners were in use and which values they
                                                had.
                                        
                                                A typical example of what you might see in the POST request might be:

                                        one_to_many_choose_phrase:
                                            type: string

                                            description: >
                                                A phrase for the choose button if no items are selected in Select Mode and
                                                <code>allow_no_selection</code> is enabled.

                                        This property allows you to open a Pop-out window when an Admin clicks on your button.
                                        A typical usage would be to display a bigger version of an image or movie.
                                
                                        This is implemented using the Colorbox library.

commented_out_html_description: |
    <p>Organizer is built on static YAML files, written in the zenario User Interface Language (TUIX), which describe and give structure to its sections and Panels.</p>
    <p>Organizer Apps, which are zenario Modules, are written in the same language and using the same schema as Organizer - which is an App itself.</p>
    <p>In order to add functionality to Organizer, your Module must contain one or more YAML files in its&nbsp;<code>tuix/organizer&nbsp;</code>subdirectory.
        (There is no need to have multiple files, but if your App has multiple sections we would recommend that you create one file per section.)</p>
    <p>The YAML files serve as a map or plan of what functionality your Plugin adds to Organizer, and where.</p>
    <p>For example, a YAML property may define the buttons which are added to Organizer, or the top level links that appear at the left hand-side.</p>
    <p>When developing Organizer Apps, the flow of the Schema is one-way. Your YAML files are read by the CMS on the server and turned into a PHP array, which then passes them to the client as JSON. The client does not pass the JSON object back, but instead replies using <code>GET</code> or&nbsp;<code>POST</code> AJAX requests.</p>
    <h2>The top level items</h2>
    <p>The first things in the Organizer Schema are the top level items. These add links to the left-hand panel in Organizer.</p>
    <p>Note: if you wish to include functionality in Organizer you must either create a top level item to contain it, or to place your functionality within another Module's top level item.</p>
