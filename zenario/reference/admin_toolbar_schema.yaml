        description: >
            This controls the order in which elements are drawn on the screen.
            
            If not set, it defaults to the order the CMS finds them in.
            
            From version 7.3 onwards, if you are inserting elements into another module's TUIX,
            you can use syntax of the form "name_of_other_element.001"
            to place an element after the named element in the order.
    copy_of: &copy_of
        type: string
        description: >
            You can enter the code-name of another element (this must be element with the same
            parent element) to copy the properties from.
            
            Any other properties you set will override the copied properties.
            
            If the element that you are attempting to copy is missing, unset, or not yet loaded,
            then your element will be removed.
            
            This works from version 8.0 onwards.
    hidden: &hidden
        type: boolean
        description: >
            <p>If you want to hide and show TUIX elements such as toolbar buttons, toolbar tabs or Admin Box fields in different situations, you can set the <span class="code">&lt;hidden&gt;</span> property to hide them in your php methods such as <span class="code">fillAdminToolbar()</span>, <span class="code">formatAdminBox()</span> and <span class="code">preFillOrganizerPanel()</span>.</p>
            <p>Anything with the hidden property set to true will be hidden from view. Be aware that data is still sent from the server to the client.</p>
    visible_if: &visible_if
        type:
            - string
            - object
        description: >
            A snippet of JavaScript code to be evaluated.
            
            From version 7.5 onwards, to avoid using an inefficent eval(), you can also call a function
            by using an object of the form:
                lib.methodName => arg1, arg2, arg3, ...
            
            The visible_if property hides elements from view if the code provided does not evaluate to <code>true</code>.
            
            See https://zenar.io/visibility-in-tuix for examples.

                                            You would use this option if you wanted them to select a location or a refiner
                                            in Organizer rather than an item specifically; you can check the variables

                                            A phrase for the choose button if no items are selected in Select Mode and

                                    This property allows you to open a Pop-out window when an Admin clicks on your button.
                                    A typical usage would be to display a bigger version of an image or movie.
