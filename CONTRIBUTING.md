Zenario allows you to write your own custom modules to add new features to the CMS.
If you would like help to get started please see our
[Developer Guides](https://zenar.io/developer-documentation).
You can also create your own skins to assign to the layouts of your site.
For more info see our guides for [Creating a skin](https://zenar.io/creating-a-skin).

If you wish to contribute your modules and skins to our repository then:

* Please submit skins as subdirectories in the zenario_custom/templates/grid_templates/skins
  directory.
* Please submit modules as subdirectories in the zenario_custom/modules directory.
* Please make sure that your PHP code meets the guidelines stated in the
  [Standards and security](https://zenar.io/standards-and-security) section of our website.

We can't currently accept pull requests to the core software, although we will address
any reported bugs.
